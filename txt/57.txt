Bernhard and I left Florence today- the Lotto still unfinished. Obrist spent the day with me, up to our starting. He is himself going to Munich in a few days. I read “L’education sentimentale”  and enjoyed it very much, in spite of the contradiction between the story-teller and the describer. All those minute descriptions made it seem like an old, old novel, from another time, but the talk, the life, was curiously up to date.
Bernhard read “La vita italiana nel Cinquecento”.
