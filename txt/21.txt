Bernhard has gone to dine with Miss Paget. I am getting better. The great event, which cheered up our gloom, was the arrival of his BOOK, “The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance”, clothed alas! in a tasteless gown of Putnam’s devising - upon which we were not even consulted. It could scarcely be worse or more unsuited to what we wanted the book to be! Still it is nice to be published in any form.
Bernhard has sold another picture to Mr. Davis. I think that is all my news.
I have just read Howells’ “Annie Kilburn” - and liked it until it began to be a story.
