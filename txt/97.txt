 Gentile Bellini - that still unknown factor in Venetian art. Bernhard wants to revive it, as he has done with Alvise Vivarini. Long review of Lotto evidently by an enemy (whether personal or merely an enemy to “Morellianism”) in the Nation. I went down to Florence - it seems like a real expedition - and shopped and called on Emily.  Saw Miss Boord in the street. Emily says all the German women she knows adore Ekkehardt as a  real  book! We read Coleridge in the evening. Ray has learned to skate. Mother writes that she can get all round the Regent Park Pond, “with her little legs wide apart and her arms waving like windmills.” The angel!
