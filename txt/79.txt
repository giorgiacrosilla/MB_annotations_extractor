 Went to look at drawings in M. Chennevière’s room upstairs - the Bellini sketch-book, and the Codex Vallardi.

Bernhard called on Mrs. Perry and saw some Pissaro water-colour sketches - I called on Reinach and he met me there. We lunched with Loeser and went to see the  Rouart  collection (34 rue de Lisbonne) of Degas, Manet, Corot and above all Daumier. Awfully tired!

Drawings in portfolios in Louvre. Bernhard lunched with Bing and saw his marvellous Japanese things, while I took Mrs. Hapgood to Durand-Ruel’s and the Louvre. We spent the evening with the Reinachs.

Strange letter from HO. Bernhard saw Duret’s and Camondo’s pictures. We heard  Berlioz’ Requiem  at the Colonne and worked in the evening.
