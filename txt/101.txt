At work on the pamphlet about the New Gallery - Emily came to lunch, and we had a talk about Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, and Andrea Castagno. Bernhard went to see Salvini in one of Scribe’s plays in the evening, and spent the night with Loeser. Loeser was busy writing something to prove that Bernhard’s “Lotto” was all wrong. When at last it came to a question of what he based himself on, he pulled out a drawing which, to him, was Alvise Vivarini’s only authentic drawing, and which turned out to be -  a Flemish copy of a group from Filippino’s frescoes in S. Maria sopra Minerva!! und so weiter.
