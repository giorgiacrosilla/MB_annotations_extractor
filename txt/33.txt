 Baldwin called and told two delicious American stories. One was of a baptism in a creek in New England, his father, the Presbyterian Minister standing on the bridge looking on half disapprovingly. A crowd was standing about in reverent awe. The Baptist Minister came to baptising his own daughter, and as he ducked her under with one hand, he waved the other to his rival on the bridge and shouted, “You can’t do that in a bowl!”Another Baptist congregation in Ausonia, Connecticut, finding that pneumonia and other diseases followed in the wake of open-air baptisms, set up a so-called “baptistry” in their church, namely a tank of heatable water under the moveable floor of the platform. The Minister was noticed going to the church very early every Sunday morning  The Thomson - such a dear person - has an irritating way of saying, “Dear me! dear me! do you know that’s very fine what you were just saying, Vernon!!” Dr. [0033] Baldwin called and told two delicious American stories.
