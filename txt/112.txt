Monday, March 11, 1895, Villa Rosa, Fiesole
Began  Wahlverwandtschaften . Worked on Ferrarese lists. Read a book on  Prostitution dans l’Antiquité , which gave me bad dreams. Read some Rossetti and early German poetry. 
Tuesday, March 12, 1895 
We are both reading  Nietzsche  these days, I still plodding along in “ Jenseits von Gut und Böse ”.
Bernhard has finished  Götzendämmerung  and is now reading “ Also sprach Zarathustra ”.
He is also reading Montaigne.

Another quiet day of books. Bernhard went in to dine with the Frenches, and Maud continued her biography for my benefit, which we take occasion to go on with when he is away. I have a read respect for people who can make their history so objective and can be really sincere about it  that  is the real way to help on the world.
