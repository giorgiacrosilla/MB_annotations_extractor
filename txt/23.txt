Bernhard read Thausing’s Dürer and I read Taine’s “L’Ideal de l’Art”.I wrote to Loeser explaining to him why I would not be friendly with him.

Letters, etc. Bernhard read Hegel. I took Miss Hallowell to the Gallery and she came here to tea. Bernhard drew her out as to her plans. Fancy - she an Annex girl, and her idea of preparing to teach modern literature was to read say George Meredith and then sit down and write about him - and teach that, and make her scholars do that - !! It would be awfully funny, but somehow it pains one to think of such mis-education, and all that time and money spent on it. Bernhard talked to her like an angel, and promised to put her on a better track.
