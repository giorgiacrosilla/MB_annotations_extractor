 puts in enough detail in the middle distance to indicate the salient character of the person (cf. Impressionist and miniature painting), whereas Flaubert in L’education sentimentale, and often the de Goncourts, crowd their middle distance with detail, etc. Interesting criticism. After our walk, suddenly Fafner Hapgood came, and we spent the rest of the day and evening talking. He stayed here all night. He is a great dear. He had dined on Sunday night with Obrist, whom he liked.

Went in with Fafner and saw the Academy, Pitti and Uffizi. Took tea at Loeser’s. Read Evan Harrington.
The day was rather spoiled for me, by getting irritated at Bernhard, who was very rude to me in the gallery, over one of the Fra Angelicos, when I agreed with Fafner that its colour was horrible. Thereafter, being irritated himself, he strove to say as many annoying things as he could.
