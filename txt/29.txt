 outrageous that law that gives the father the right to determine the children’s religion. Yet perhaps, on a wide view, it makes for civilization, considering that more fathers are atheists than mothers. Alas! 
Fabbri spent the afternoon here, looking at Lotto photographs. He judges everything by the Velasquez or Japanese standard, and prefers Botticelli to Bellini. Bernhard dined at the Palmerino.

Worked at Lotto during the day. The proofs of my article in the XIX Century came.We lunched at Loeser’s with Miss Hallowell, and there made our first real acquaintance with Outamaro and his master. We passed a couple of hours of absolutely lyric joy looking at those things. His collection is very unequal. His rooms are furnished with exquisite taste. He seemed rather nice, and I am glad we have tried to heal up the quarrel.
