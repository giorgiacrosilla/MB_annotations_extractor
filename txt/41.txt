 lo! it was delightful - a fairy dream, executed in marble with such fine tact and delicacy and originality that it made us happy for the rest of the day. Obrist spoke so picturesquely of his own mind as if it were a block of marble, and said he had chipped a chiselled and polished away every trace of academic tradition. And indeed his work was original. You saw the compatriot of Böcklin, but a man with a more delicate fancy, better taste, and more feeling for his art as art. The  relief  was a perfect illustration of all that Bernhard has been preaching about relief for the last month! Enthusiastic letters about “The Venetian Painters” keep coming in - Today a lady talked of translating it into French!! Mr. Fisher called on Bernhard, and I met them at lunch. Bernhard took Miss A.[nstruther] Thomson to the Medici Tombs and the Masaccios, and I took Fisher to the Uffizi. We three then met here, and had a really delightful talk about scientific history, and then Bernhard took him to call on Mr. Benn. In the evening Emily and Miss Rea and Loeser dined with us, and then came here and talked until eleven and very pleasantly. Emily is really charming.
