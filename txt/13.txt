Mother and father and Alys all wrote that Knowles has accepted my article on art-criticism for The XIX Century. I am glad, but not elated. -  I believe my first article in the “Woman’s Herald” gave me more pleasure. Emily and I saw the rest of the Botticelli illustrations to Dante and some buildings, etc., and after lunch the Academy. Bernhard took Miss Thompson to the Uffizi, and made her wax enthusiastic over  ---Alessio Baldovinetti!! We took tea in his rooms and looked at Giorgione photographs. They said I had a “Giorgione cranium”. I am trying a patent medicine called “Orange Blossom”, and it makes me feel rather bimbly.
