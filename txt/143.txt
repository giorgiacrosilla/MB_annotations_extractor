Monday passed quietly - Bernhard studying Giotto, and spending night at Loeser’s. Tuesday I lunched at Emily’s, and her mother talked such a lot of commonplace weariness that I thought of Bertie’s protest against her, “No rubbish shot here”- She does shoot rubbish! Another series of untrue platitudes from Vernon Lee, under the head of “Art and Luxury”. The funny thing was the audience, consisting chiefly of Countesses - Rasponi, Pasolini, Jennison, Niccolini, Count Papafava, and then the commoners Fabbri, Mr. Baring and ourselves. Today I began getting ready the children’s “Thinking Lessons” for publication. Mr. Benn came to lunch and took a walk with Bernhard. Count Puliga, the von der Hellens with their children, and Mr. C. D. Warner to tea.
