Gallery in the morning - Miss Sellers came to lunch at Obrist’s, and at four we three started to come here, arriving about 8.30. All the way we talked. Saw Obrist’s glorious new embroideries.

Swims, walks and such divine talks. As Michael once said, “I know from experience what it was to listen to the great teachers, like Sokrates and Abelard, whose words kindled men like flames, for I have heard ‘The Doctrine’ ”. So it has been. Obrist is a dear, but being an artist, he isn’t a critic, and Bernhard has simply proved himself a divine critic, who knows what and why he enjoys. I have felt like a child between them, and have been simply overwhelmed with Bernhard’s genius.
