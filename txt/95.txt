Writing again. Studied Alvise photos. Poetry in evening. Michael wrote an angry letter bidding us “sail out of her life as if we had never been - Bon voyage, illusion perdue!” - à propos of a misunderstanding. What a lack of psychology, proving her completely of the old generation. Of course it means next to nothing. People who mean those things don’t write them - as Heine says.

Again grinding away at my writing. Snow! snow! snow! and horrible cold. Looked at Buonsignori and Cima photos. Read Frere’s translation of Aristophanes’ Birds.

Writing. Cook came to lunch, and we connoshered until 5. Wrote again and again read the Birds.
