Emily and Miss Dodge came and we walked with them and Fafner to Mr. Morgan’s, up on the hill. Read Job in the evening.

Miss Lowndes, Miss Dodge and Emily came to lunch, and Miss Thomson and the Countess Rasponi afterwards. We had a lecture on Fra Angelico. Mr. and Mrs. Hapgood and Fafner came up at 3.30, also Evelyn’s friend Miss Hale and Mary and Eliza Stuart, and we had a huge (for us!) tea, and then all walked down through the Podere. Still influenza.

A rather lazy day, with a feeling of influenza. Sent off a note to the Chronique des Arts. C. D. Warner called in the afternoon, and was most charming. He told us a lot about the natural oil regions in America, and the Grand Cañon of the Colorado. Finished Job. Bernhard got £38.6.10 for two months of his “Lotto”.

Bernhard lunched with Placci and called on the Toys, and had a long talk with Mr. Toy. I had a quiet day of writing. We read Esther in the evening.
