 
Oscar Wilde is emprisoned for two years, with hard labour. It makes me quite miserable, for although I came to the conclusion he was somehow a loathesome [ sic ] beast when he was here last spring, yet surely he was so much more use than harm - even granting the charges are true. And when you think of how common the vice is, it is sickening to think that the punishment has fallen on the most brilliant of them all. To have known him so well! It is horrible to have to think what his feelings must be. Poor Oscar! I have a secret hope it may turn out well for him in the end, for I believe him  capable  of better work than he has ever done.
