Friday, July 19, 1895, Mainz
A most satisfactory day. We took a cup of black coffee at the station at 7, and then went by train to Frankfort a/M, reaching there at 8, where we had some stupendo coffee at the xx Casino. We then “did” the town, ending up at 10 at the Städel Institut, where we stayed till one. It is a splendid collection. Perhaps a huge triptych by Roger van der Weyden impressed us more than anything else, the splendidly decorative Christ on the Cross with a Japanese landscape, like a stronger, more human Crivelli. We lunched at the Casino, expensive but good, with superb coffee! - and then came back and “did” the Museum here (Lor.[enzo] di Credi, Defendente da Ferrari, and Tiepolo) and the Cathedral. Dined at the xSchwann, 7 Liebfrauenplatz, an excellent place.
