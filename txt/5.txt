February 14, 1894, 12 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Florence
It is a “turning-point”, I suppose, to be thirty years old, as I am today. Well, we spent 15 l. extra in celebrating the festa, for we took a long delicious drive in the sunshine, and went to Doney’s to dine and had such a bottle of Montepulciano as it entereth not into the mind of man to conceive!
But I must go back eleven days  when we met again at Pistoia after nearly two months, which I had spent chiefly in being ill, alas! and Bernhard had spent in reading: Gaspari’s Italian Literature,
D’Ancona’s various writings, XIII century Italian poetry, many “Sacre Rappresentazioni”,
Browning’s “Guelfs and Ghibellines”, Pennington’s “History of the Church in Italy”, Ulmann’s Botticelli,
Sabatier’s « François d’Assise », Schmarsow’s Giovanni Santi, Howells’ “World of Chance”, and Scott’s “Antiquary” etc. etc.
