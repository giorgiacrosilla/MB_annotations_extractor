 his son-in-law, the Marchese Farinola, a small “Last Communion of St. Jerome” by Botticelli - a little gem, almost among his best. Placci could thoroughly enjoy the purely decorative part, the bed covered with sheepskin and the crucifix and palms and cedars above it, and the matting roof and walls, but the representative element distressed him. Instead of getting abstract values of motion, he felt like a feeble old man, or a young priest or acolyte holding up a heavy body or candles. So we went to the Primavera, and there again the representative elements distressed him - the blueness of the figure to the right, the flowers coming out of the woman’s mouth, etc. But he began to see, after a while, the marvellous pattern of space and lines weaving in and out. We went to look at the back of the Duomo, and then came home and had tea and a divine hour listening to him and to Buonamici playing Wagner’s Siegfried Idyll, the Hundigung March,
and Humperdinck’s Hansel and Grethel. A walk home by moonlight, a good dinner, unpacking new books, reading - and so ended a nice day.
