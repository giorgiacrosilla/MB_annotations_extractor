 journey. What a beauty! It is clearly Florentine, end of XV or beginning of XVI century, but is it Leonardo? It is modelled like Leonardo, but the type is strangely Raphaelesque and so is the composition. Altogether it is the loveliest modern thing I have ever seen. (I put in “modern”, for I remember that wonderful little ivory Madonna from the XII century, in the Bargello). Bernhard is reading  Nietzsche  and I “ Vâter und Söhne ” by Tourgenieff.
