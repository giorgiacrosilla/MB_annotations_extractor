 Inhalt. Then, upstairs, there is a sculptured head of Medusa, a portrait of a woman - grey and green and brass-yellow - a centaur battle, an allegory of life, glaring in colour, a dead Christ, a mermaid-play, a perfectly banal, vulgar portrait of himself, an (early) Diane Ã  la chasse, and a scene in a wood at autumn where a procession of white-robed figures is coming to worship at a flaming altar, by a pool. The only one of these that really moved me was the last, although there are humorous episodes in the mermaids, even so much life and energy in the centaurs, undeniable poetry in the life allegory, and interesting tone in the woman. But this picture was like a note struck that sets marvellous 
We saw a Dead Christ by Holbein which was exquisite in tone, and almost like a Crivelli in drawing, besides being poetical - almost sublime - in interpretation. We went also to the Cathedral, and after lunch came back to read and write - the line not being mended yet.
