Called on Reinach, who was very nice. Went with him and M. Dreyfus to the Louvre, and were nearly bored to death by “shop” talk about the outsides of pictures. Called on Ephrussi of the Gazette des Beaux Arts, and came back absolutely “in a state of complete prostitution”, as the lady said, from the ennui of associating in such a way with such people! M. Reinach knew, of American writers, Poe, Hawthorne and Mark Twain.

Met Loeser in the Louvre and lunched with him. Went to call on  Anquetin , a Normandy painter of 33 who seems like a reincarnation of Michelangelo. His work is very strong. We all liked him too.

Sent off some of my Hampton Court Guide, and went to M. Dreyfus at 1 and saw the Sciarra and Goldschmidt pictures.
