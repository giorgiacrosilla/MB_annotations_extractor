 states that  motio n is the only thing represented, and that all other emotional effects are merely associative. Motion is the  Urbild  of music, and motion alone.

Nietzsche is a Walt Whitman à rebours - finding every actual thing vile because of the intensity of life and power he desires. Men seem weak and absurd, and all religions and human institutions contemptible. But for all that, he is an optimist, and immensely inspiring, for his gospel is Life and all that “makes for Life, energy, power.” 
Bernhard began his article on Italian pictures in America and I finished Le Vergini delle Rocce,
etc. in the morning. We drove into Florence and did some errands.
Fabbri came to dinner and we talked about whether great art is popular - starting from the commonplace saying that “truly great art appeals to all classes of people.” Bernhard held that in the one case where it had been thoroughly tried on great masses of naive people - the case of Folk Songs and Ballads and the goods - the goods only had been preserved.
