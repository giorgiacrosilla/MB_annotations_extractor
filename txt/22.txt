Was there ever anything more insufferably pretentious and shallow than this - from Norman Hapgood’s last letter?... “I also get a bit of science, for the musical criticism of Wagner, Berlioz, or Schumann drives me to (gas about) works on acoustics, as criticism of painting drives me to (talk about studying) the laws of light, architecture to mathematics, and so on in the same old circle of more or less steady (!) interest.” He also talks in the same letter of an ideal set of people “with a Voltairean (sic!) smile on their lips and a load of loathing and discouragement on their hearts” - What an ass a nice boy can be when he is miseducated!
