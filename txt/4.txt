Solus in occultis degens Ieronimus antris
Hic recubo montis accola chimerici
Vnde mare et terras tenebrosumque aera cerno
Et video caelum quod colo sydereum.
Ancona, May 1893
Under the wide and starry sky
Dig my grave and let me lie,
Glad did I live and gladly die,
And I laid me down with a will.
This be the verse ye grave for me:
Here he lies where he longed to be.
Home is the sailor, home from the sea,
And the hunter home from the hill.
Robert Louis Stevenson
