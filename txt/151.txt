 in the church, returning by the 10 o’clock boat. The best of all was the beautiful Giorgionesque hostess at the little Caffé. We missed the church by Solari at Riva, though Bernhard tried to make out it was a horrible little affair we were mis-directed to! Aha! Arrived here about 8.30.

This is a town of splendid palaces - and above all the Renaissance part of the Castello. We have enjoyed it very much.
Monday and Tuesday, July 8-9, 1895, Gasthaus zu Rose, Sterzing
A quaint little Tyrolese town with charming walks, and most delicious bracing air. We had a long walk to Woer, in which I was rather cross, as I got tired.
