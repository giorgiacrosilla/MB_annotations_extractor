 Botticelli Dante illustrations - also S. Maria Novella and the Donatello lion in the Casa Martelli. Emily and her friend Miss Rea and Jenkins all came to tea. Afterwards Bernhard and I went to San Miniato with Emily [Dawson] and Miss Rea. Loeser joined us at dinner at the “Antica Luna” in order to tell us about his visit to the Gordigianis in their villa. He was naively self-important. He thinks, and it is probably true, that they want him to marry the Gordigiani girl - whom he alludes to as Giulietta. He says, however, that she is in love with Costa. She is a very fine musician, and a constant smoker and hard drinker. After he had gone, Bernhard read  Goldwin Smith  and I read [Huysmans’] “ À vau-l’eau” .
