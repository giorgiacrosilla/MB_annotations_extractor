 whom I found quite alone, I helped work on the review. We quarrelled, as we usually do when we work together, but made it up out of good sense. (Letters from Evelyn X.)

Called on Reinach, worked over Botticelli, had nice talks. Went to see Sarah Bernhardt in Gismonda.

Took Mme Reinach to the Louvre. There is a fearful tragedy there - the worst of all - the tragedy of being loved. She is dying of ennui. She thinks he enjoys nothing, but the real truth is, his enjoyment is his active brain with information - “job lots”- as Bernhard said, in traditional Jew fashion! We lunched with Loeser and then B.B. went to call on M. Dreyfus. Loeser and Sturges came to dinner and we went to see M. Rouart’s Japanese things, next door to Reinach. At 9.30 B.B. and I went in to Reinach, and had a lot of hopping talk. Mme Reinach came in and told me she did not enjoy a single thing she did.
