Sunday, March 17, 1895, Fiesole
Loeser, Emily and Miss Jane Dodge, Fafner’s friend, came to lunch. We had a walk, tea, much talking, etc. She is a delicate, sensitive little creature, in looks and temperament, much like Evalyne. Quite tired with so much chatting and laughter.
The editor of the Atlantic wrote to ask me to send him an article on Morellianism. Bernhard unwell.

Placci took Bernhard to Alessandri’s, where he found 2 Pesellinis and some Ben[ozzo] Gozzolis. He stayed to lunch with Placci, Ginori and Buonamici. I had a note from Ephrussi of the [Gazette des] Beaux Arts asking me to contribute notes on Italian things. After tea we had a walk.  Bernhard felt better, but still feeble.
