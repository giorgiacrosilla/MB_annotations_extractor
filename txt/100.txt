The great event of the day was the arrival and spreading of our Japanese rugs. I wrote my Lafenestre review in the morning. Bernhard went in to Florence, and I arranged things a little in his house, for his remark that it looked “just like a priest’s house’ touched my heart! In the evening we read a little Browning before Maud went down to write letters, and afterwards I read  Symonds ’  Greek Poets , Perry, etc., while Bernhard read medieval French poetry.

I spent quite a time this morning thinking over the “lessons of the year”. I believe the upshot of it all is a hatred of any kind of deceit … a most valuable lesson to learn,  if  I really have leant it. 
We wrote in the morning, and then Bernhard went to lunch with the Scotts and Maud and I went to call on Miss Belle Duffy, who is staying with Mr. Hamilton. She was very sniffy. We tried to read Emerson’s so-called poetry in the evening, but it was a failure. Ditto Poe.
