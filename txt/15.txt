Walked and read as usual. Went over the Hampton Court Guide, which I finished and made up to send off tomorrow. We had a wonderful afternoon walk in the Pineta and on the shore. The mountains glowed like amethysts and sapphires.

After a quarrel (a propos of Bernhard’s nails), which we made up, we had a nice walk in the pine woods. Bernhard finds Pater’s “Plato” terribly dull, although it is a model of construction. We came back, arriving here at 7, and found various nice letters, etc. By the way, when Emily was here, Bernhard made a comparison worth recording, saying that some remarks are like drawing down those heavy iron shutter fronts they use in the shops here. How much better this describes the sensation than the old “wet blanket”!
