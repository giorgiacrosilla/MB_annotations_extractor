Line not mended. Bernhard spent most of the day writing a review of Mrs. Ady’s “Raphael”, which I copied and sent to the Courrier des Arts and the Chronicle. Also I entered into note-books the pictures exhibited at the London Venetian Exhibition. We quarrelled about Barye’s landscapes … and passed on from that to many other subjects of dispute. I made up my mind to tell him the whole Obrist story - when we are once settled in Florence.
