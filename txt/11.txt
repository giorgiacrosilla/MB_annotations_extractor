 Rossetti. Its prose may be called the bastard of Meredith. In fact, it nearly drove me crazy!

I took Mr. and Mrs. Hapgood to the Bargello. She seemed to enjoy it, but he, like “Vernon Lee”, was ever hastening on to try to get something out of the next thing which the last had failed to give him. After lunch we went to Alinari’s to look at photos, and I hired a piano and got Gluck’s “Orfeo” as a beginning. I enjoyed reading it over. We found some enchanting tea-cakes, enchanting!  Emily Dawson came at 7, and she and I dined together at Cesare’s. Bernhard dined at the Luna, and went to call on the Forbes. It has turned excessively cold.
