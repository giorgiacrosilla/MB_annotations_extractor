Worked in the morning, and after lunch I went in to see Bernhard off to Milan, where he is going on business. Then I called on Emily, and afterwards came on up. Finished  Fogazzaro’s Daniele Cortis .

Finished and sent off the pamphlet on the New Gallery - Miss Paget came to call, bringing with her as usual a topsy-turvy literary world which reminds me that the other night as we were talking of Henry James, and the sterile type of American he writes about, Bernhard compared it to a botanist spending all his time on those bits of pollen-dust that are blown out to sea and never fertilize anything. 
Also he compared the Bicci to Darwin’s earth worms, digging up the artistic soil, the uneducated public,  >
