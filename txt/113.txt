Called at Loeser’s for Bernhard and we did a lot of shopping. Miss Thomson and Emily came to lunch, and the Countess Rasponi after, and we had an interesting lecture on Donatello, after which Bernhard and I took a walk. At dinner and until 9 we discussed - what they are – I read Nietzsche till 10.30 while Bernhard went on reading early German ballads.

Went to the Scalzi with Maud, Emily and Miss Thomson: then to the Academy. Maud and I lunched with Loeser, then Bernhard and I called on Miss <Janet> Dodge and came up here, meeting Loeser and Maud on the way. A wonderful night. We walked out to Fiesole and saw the stars.

Went to Vernon Lee’s and had a “santa Conversazione”, chiefly about Lauder - she is à rebours as usual!
