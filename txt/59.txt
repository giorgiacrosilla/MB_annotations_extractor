 school mistress, a pretty Bergamask young woman of 22, came in to chat with us. Her salary is 600 francs a year, and two rooms. She was clever and evidently a free-thinker. Out of her own head she had organized a course in history for her pupils, beginning with ’48 and ending with the unity of Italy. She said that superstitions still reigned, among the women and children, and that in Peghera alone, a miserable, tiny little place, with nothing but a foot-path leading to it, there were four witches. She told us about the  Par[r]occo  who had just been sent away, on account of a young woman. Poor  Par[r]occo , he was only 29 years old, and very “liberal”- she liked him and got on well with him in the school. The young woman was married  to the Priest’s father .
