Placci and Prince Wolkonski came to lunch on Saturday. We had a nice talk about Beauty. On Sunday, Emily came to tea and Fabbri to dinner. All he could say about the effect on him of a work of art was that it ‘put him into a kind of dreamy state’. Michael said it made her feel “God’s in his heaven - all’s well with the world.” Her friend, Miss Ellis, said it made her want to cry, and Miss Hall said it made her pray.
