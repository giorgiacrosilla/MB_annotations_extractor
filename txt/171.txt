 she says, that she ever spent. Sturges told us of one morning when Whistler came for Logan and met Zangwill in his rooms. Zangwill tried his “new humour” at Whistler, without success. Leaning over him, he said, “What’s that?” pointing to his decoration -“The Legion of Honour” -  “I suppose they call it that,” pursued Zangwill, “because there are ten thousand of them knocking about the streets.” “It is the way a great nation pays a great honour to a great artist,” replied Whistler.
Sturges is most picturesque in talk. He refines a phrase until every word is significant. His defect is that he will not listen, and this habit is sure to grow on him, I fear.
