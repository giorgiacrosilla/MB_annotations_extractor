Breakfasted with Bernhard and discussed, as we usually do, the relation between the personality of the artist and his inherited and acquired form of art-expression. Bernhard lunched with the Hapgoods and walked with Mr. Hapgood from Fiesole to Settignano, and I came here in the late afternoon. We looked at Botticelli photos and talked in the evening.

A quiet grey day, which I have enjoyed, and would have enjoyed more if Bernhard had been here. I am rather worse, so I lay down practically all day. I read Pater’s “Plato and Platonism”, and “Peer Ghynt”,  and “Vernon Lee’s “Conferenza” upon Italian painting. We talked too, Miss Paget very brilliantly. An artist came to dinner and talked her nearly blind, but Miss Thomson and I took refuge in Titian photos. Miss T[homson] met Loeser and thought him absolutely detestable.
