We worked as usual in the morning. I began an article for the  Chronique  on the Italian pictures in the South of France Galleries, of which I finished the rough draft in the evening.
It was raining, but as it let up about 3 we went out for a walk round by Vincigliata, but got caught in a torrent on the way home. I read  Klinger ’s brochure on  Malerei und Zeichnung , and Bernhard went on with Tarde’s  Lois de l’Imitation . We also read German poetry.
