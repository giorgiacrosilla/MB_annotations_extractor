Tuesday, April 3, 1894, Florence
We went house-hunting, slightly to the detriment of our tempers - over the Fiesole hill in the morning.
Miss A.[nstruther] Thomson came to look at photographs of sculpture in the afternoon and Fabbri to tea.
I called on Miss Hallowell and found her in a rapture of youthful enthusiasm for us both - the enthusiasm having been called out by a letter from her mother warning her to have nothing to do with either of us. She is particularly anxious to go to Lucca with us, because it is a chance to let her parents see that she does mean to “lead her own life”. Since she gave up the idea of being a doctor - for which she had succeeded in successfully asserting her independence - they have been hoping she would fall back in the “daughter at home” again, and her mother has been writing to her to get plenty of nice party dresses, so that they can go out together and be happy as they were four years ago. She thinks Bernhard the cleverest man alive and me the most emancipated and superior woman she has ever met!!
