Letter to HO
… “Böcklin and Klinger arouse your fancy, they suggest flights of visions, etc., etc. Why, you ask, are they not Art? It is our old contention, and you do not seriously intend me to go over all the arguments once more? Still for a moment I will linger over this. Is it not time - please be accurately introspective here - that first you feel a cerebral activity, and then and then only something approaching, yet only vaguely, I think, the condition of definite bien-être. But this sort of thing is not at all artistic. It happens to every man over any matter that rouses his cerebral activity in a satisfactory way, and consequently the surgeon speaks of a beautiful cancer, the mathematician of a beautiful problem, etc. The ‘beautiful’ so used - your use also - is only a sign of gratitude to a something that has started your cerebration. You personally perhaps have a poor visual memory, and a consequently poor constructive - i.e., illustrating - fancy.
