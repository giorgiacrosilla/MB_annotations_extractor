Lotto. Cook came to lunch, and we had an all-day gorge on connoisseuring. He stayed to dinner. Although a  Balliol  man, he had never heard of Pater, and never read a word of Browning.

Lotto. Mr. Hamilton came to lunch. He has cured himself of his auto-suggested illness, which kept him on his back for 20 years - he thought he would be so happy - would wake up to life with the nerves of a boy - But he wakes up with the nerves of a man over 50, and finds nothing makes him happy. Like Mr. Bennett, he asks, “Is  this  the party?” Walked, worked, and read Elizabethan lyrics in the evening … but most of them proved very dull to all three of us.
