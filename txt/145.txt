Wednesday, June 12, 1895
Life has been going on quietly.The von der Hellens, Benns, Placci and a socialist friend of his named Gaetano Salvemini (a brilliant boy of 22), Mr. Morgan, Loeser, Count Papafava, Count Puliga, Fabbri, Emily, etc., have all been here from time to time. Now they have all gone except Placci and his friend and Mr. Morgan and Puliga - and of them we see little. Even Maud has gone, and Bernhard and I are living quietly here, he writing his “Florentine Painters”, and I type-writing it and doing the lists, and writing out the “Thinking Lessons”- etc., busy and happy. But I am lazy about writing, and all that is important now will go into the “Florentines”, for it is our meat and drink.
