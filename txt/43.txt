Drove in for my trunk - which was left by mistake, and letters, and caught a glimpse of Bernhard, who said he had dined with Loeser. Read Vernon Lee’s “ Countess of Albany ” and “ Hauntings ”, and her brother’s poems, which someone compared to a mixture of Shakspeare [ sic ] and Gilbert! Read aloud a good deal to Mr. Hamilton, who says that now that he is getting better, he doesn’t think writing poetry is worthwhile.

Read a good deal of  Anna Karenina  to Mr. Hamilton and the rest (the part about Anna and Wronsky) to myself. What a tremendous story! I read also  Vernon Lee ’s “ Ottilie” , “ Prince of the 100 Soups ” and a dozen  articles  of hers, and Mary Robinson’s  Margaret of Navarre , also Henry James’  Private Life  and  Macaulay ’s essay on  Ranke ’s Popes.
