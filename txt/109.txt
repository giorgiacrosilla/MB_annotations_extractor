German etc., in the morning. Too snowy to go to town. But the afternoon was wonderful, and after posting Bernhardâ€™s review of the Burlington Ferrarese Catalogue, we took one of the nicest walks we have ever had along the road to Monte Senario and through the Poderi. The streams were bursting out in every direction. Bernhard said the pleasure the sound of rushing water gives our ears is equivalent to the pleasure our eyes take in a swirl of lines. When we returned Miss Paget and Miss Thomson were here, and we chatted and looked at photos. Bernhard went to dine with them, and I studied German and read Ferrari, etc.
