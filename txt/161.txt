 
Sunday, July 21, 1895, Trier
First we saw the impressive Cathedral, with its Roman feeling for space, then the Gothic “Madonna delle Carceri”, the exquisite Liebfrauenkirche, a cruciform equal-armed Gothic [diagram] (the choir, however, being a little lengthened out). In front a statue of the Synagogue came almost up to the Rheims things, except for the barbarous “Ideenkunstler” idea of making a huge crown toppling off one side of her head! Then we saw the ruins of the Palace, and the magnificent Basilica, prowled through the Museum and came back to a perfect gorge of a Sunday table d’hôte! I could do nothing but sleep after, but I waked up eventually and copied in our notes. After supper we walked out and saw the bridge, and discussed the essence of poetry. I read “Luria”, “In a Balcony”, and “The Soul’s Tragedy”, and Bernhard Hauptmann’s “Die Weber”.
The  Gasthof zum Post  looked very nice and much quieter than this.
