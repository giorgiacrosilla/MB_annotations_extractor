Loeser came to lunch, and stayed and nearly drove me crazy talking, when the others all went out. Fafner still here.

Rainy and cloudy. Lord Ronald Gower - a noted Sodomite - came with an introduction from Mr. Hamilton Aidé to Bernhard, and behaved in a most sickening way, evidently falling in love with him at first sight. We read Luke in the evening.

Rainy. Mr. Benn and Miss Hale came to lunch. We read a lot of ballads and Mr. Benn added to our definition that it must be in short lines. Talked with Miss Hale about Evelyn. Then a long, long talk with Bernhard, who certainly is trying hard to pull along after him the “slow-trotting Palma”… who seems for the moment (if it is only that) to have fallen asleep where she stood. Why have I lost heart, I wonder, just when everything is beginning to succeed? Is it because I care too much about HO?
