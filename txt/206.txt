so dead set against it, that I can only let the tooth of time gnaw at you, refraining from scratching myself. Dürer’s Malinconia, his Ritter, Tod und Teufel, contain of course  the  essentially artistic qualities of tactile values, movement, etc. But  das ergreifende dran  is that what Dürer means to express intellectually, emotional, symbolically.

You, as B.B., are so organized that you care  en dernier lieu  for tactile values, etc. (which makes you prefer Stauffer Bern to Klinger) and I am so organized that quite  en dernier lieu  I prefer the other. If that other is ‘poetry, literature’, why the devil don’t I adore Keats, Shelley?”
The answer is that each art must have  that element which makes me take it as real  before I can find in it the inexhaustibility of reality, and be affected by it lastingly.
What is that element in each of the arts?
