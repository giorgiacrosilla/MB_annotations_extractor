Worked on Lotto, while Bernhard went down to Florence to shop. He drove up with Emily, who came to lunch. Afterwards we all looked at Duccio and Giotto photographs. Bernhard’s room looks lovely!
In the evening we read Keats, and other things.

Writing on Lotto in the morning. Bernhard began his article on the Venetian Exhibition in London. I went down to the Uffizi in the afternoon, and met Mr. Cook, who was connoisseuring around.

Still settling in. Bernhard lunched with the Benns and went to the Uffizi with Cook. We read Browning etc. in the evening. He said Furtwängler was like a fox hunter, who scoured the country and beat the carrs and drove the fox into his hole - and then left him there.
