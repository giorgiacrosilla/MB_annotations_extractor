 Bria di Nizza! Then we took the train of endless tunnels and came here, and had a look at the Cathedral before sunset. Beautiful as it is is in colour, and richness of detail, as architecture, it is so much less serious, less intellectual than the French buildings we have seen. It cannot for a moment compare with St. Sernin of Toulouse. Even the marble looks like a coating. It has none of the solidity of Roman or Northern Romanesque building. It does not  exist  first of all. It begins and ends with ornamentation. 
Curiously, for the first time we noticed the fine old stained glass and the richly carved pillars of the portals of the Cathedral and Baptistery. One needs to go to the same place a dozen times for different things that oneâ€™s eye is  peeled  to!
