 Painters”- one in The Scottish Leader (written by Robertson), and the other in the National Observer - came this morning. 
Bernhard finished the Bonsignori section of his Lotto, and I worked on a Botticelli article. After lunch we took the steam tram for Signa, and then had a magical walk over to Montelupo, through pines and banks of white heather with a windy cloudy sky and bright bursts of sunshine - Such romance, and wildness, and beauty - ! We missed the train to Florence (6.18), so drove to Signa (3 fr. 50 mancia) where we missed the tram. But we had an excellent dinner at the caffé and a moonlight stroll, and then caught the 10 o’clock train home. We were very happy and enjoyed each other and the walk to the utmost.
