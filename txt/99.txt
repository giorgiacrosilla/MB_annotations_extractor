 look round the Uffizi with Emily. In the evening we read B.’s paper on Literature being the account of the struggle of the individual to assert himself against all the forces that tend to crush him and keep him down. We discussed it and also Rosny. Bernhard’s review of Ulmann’s Botticelli in the Revue critique came.

A very lazy day. I was ill all the afternoon, but in the morning I took notes for the Lafenestre article.
Bernhard dipped about into all sorts of books. I began  Perry’s English Literature in the XVIII Century . 
We both read  Theodore Marzials ’ poems all through, I don’t know why. This is a sample: 
Sweet
Wake
Here, take
My heart in your hand,
Break. 
Finished the Knights.
