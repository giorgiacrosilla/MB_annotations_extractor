Louvre in the morning with Fabbri and his beautiful model Stéphanie, a most Leonardesque creature. She and Miss Dodge lunched with us and we went to Durand-Ruel’s and saw again the Manets and Degas. Then I came home and slept awhile. Janey Dodge moved over to this hotel, and we three dined together and sat and talked, and after Bernhard went, we had a good deal more talk, largely about Fafner.
Saturday, September 28, 1895, Paris
Went to the Beaux Arts and the Louvre, but it was too terribly hot to work much. Fabbri and Stéphanie were there, and we looked at Rubens and Rembrandt. We all lunched together, and again went to Durand-Ruel’s, where Fabbri wobbled up and down about buying a fine Degas, two women ironing that is, one ironing, one yawning.  Afterwards, Janet and we two went to the Panthéon and St. Etienne du Mont. In the evening I dined with Alban and Emma, while Bernhard overcame Janet’s objection to going to the Weisser Hirsch. 
As Alban expounded to me his views against dancing, the theatre, billiards, and non-observance of the Sabbath, I felt as if I were a naturalist who had the privilege of observing a live Dodo or Ichth<y>osaurus.
