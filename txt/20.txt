Bernhard had a painful séance with Anstruther Thompson at the Bargello, when she attempted to “Vernonize” him too. He came home sick. I took Miss Hallowell to see the Botticellis in the Uffizi, and then went to the dentist.

It is Karin’s fifth birthday. I celebrated it by going to the dentist. Miss Hallowell and I took tea in Bernhard’s room, after he had shown her the Brancacci Chapel. She painted an awfully depressing picture of the Harvard Annex.
