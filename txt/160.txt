	Cursed be the misunderstanding which made each of us think the other  wanted  to come down the Rhine by boat. We did it, and were  bored to death ! We went out from Coblentz to the Laachersee, to see the Benedictine Church there, and tired as we were we  thoroughly enjoyed  the exquisite little cloister in front of the east fa√ßade. Ex-qui-site! We had a nice supper at the  x Central Hof at Coblentz, and then came here, reaching this hotel about 11. The trouble with the outside of most of these churches is that, as mass, they are rather inert compared to Notre Dame in Paris, Rheims, etc. Those look alive, like great beasts, or ships in full sail. These, with their modern Mansard roof - and generally rather ungainly masses, never suggest organic life.
