 function of art was to reveal that to us - Che cambiamento!! 
Tuesday, April 30, 1895 
Called on Frau von der Hellen and Mrs. Benn. 
A long talk in the evening about the origin of aesthetic emotion. The doctrine was that “the intellect is a misappropriation of funds meant to ruin the sexual bank”, and if you misappropriate too much, you go bankrupt. Miss Cruttwell gave utterance to the opinion that the only thing that could make the sexual act “bearable” was the reasoned desire to have a child. Yet she supposes herself to love and understand poetry!!
