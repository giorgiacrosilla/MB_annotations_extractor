A day with little to record, as we worked over the proofs of the Florentine Painters. We went down to the Academy in the afternoon, and spent an hour in the Library, reading the Giornali.
We discovered Michelangelo’s S. Matteo!!!

Again the damned Proofs - and a run into Florence to get the number of a Pollaiuolo. We meet Miss Hertz and a friend of hers in the Uffizi. Miss Hertz made us think of nothing but  Bouvard , except possibly Aunty Lill! Bernhard then called on La baronne Puliga (“Brada”) and on Benn, while I walked home and devoted myself to some deadly dull writing on the French provincial galleries. 
All the evening we corrected, and corrected, and corrected proofs - until nearly 11, when we read Bernhard’s article on the Italians in New York and Boston.
