Awoke to a fierce snow-storm! But it was gone, and all the snow, too, by afternoon.
Emily and Miss Anstruther Thomson came to lunch, and Bernhard talked to us enchantingly about the early Sienese. We had a nice walk, and I finished the Lafenestre in the evening. Mrs. Jack Gardner wrote that she would take 2 Peruzzis Bernhard wrote to her about, thereby causing us to rejoice, for we are low in funds and this means about Â£70.
