Monday, August 27, 1894, * Hotel dâ€™Angleterre, Beauvais 
Revisited Amiens, and found some Italian things, Guardi, Tiepolo, etc. The Puvis did not look as they once did, although we still liked them. Then we came to this enchanting quiet town, which we have greatly enjoyed. The Cathedral is fine and the place is full of interesting things. It is almost Italian, with its large open square - the old Forum - and many churches, and the moat and avenue outside.
