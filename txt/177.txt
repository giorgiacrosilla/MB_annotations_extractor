 was simply using her to satisfy his more civilized needs of female companionship, as he used the Berlin shop-girls, with whom he used to make expeditions into the country for a night to satisfy his more brutal needs. It sounds hard to say this, but when Bernhard said to him, did he never think of the effect on them, in that they might have babies, he seemed never to have thought of it, and so he never thought of what would happen to little Janet. I told her what I thought, and I think it helped to free her from Fafner. She said she had anyhow conquered the feeling - or rather grown beyond it - already, but from one or two things I observed I do not think the cure was complete. I hope it is now.

She is very sincere and very innocent, and I must say it was horrid of Fafner not to have spared her.

At 2.15 we started for Dijon, reaching this mediocre hotel at 7.30. Bernard read James’ Psychology and I Flaubert’s awfully witty Bouvard et Pécuchet.

“Did” Dijon - and came here by an evening train. Talking about Renan, I said he was the Pierre Loti of philosophy. The Gallery is a fraud.

We journeyed from 9.48 till 2.15, I laughing over Bouvard et Pécuchet and Bernhard reading [William] James and agonizing over time tables. At 2.15 we stopped
