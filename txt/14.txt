* Sunday, Feb. 25, 1894, 12 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Florence
Emily went to join her mother in Rome early in the morning. She is a nice girl, in spite of being, as I described her to Bernhard, as “ugly as a hornet”. She said I had given her the most valuable present she had ever received in Botticelli and Renaissance architecture. This morning we wrote, etc. and afterwards I finished a Chronicle review of Dr. Ulmann’s “Botticelli”. Bernhard lost himself in Pater’s “Plato”.

We reached here at 3 o’clock and had a walk in the Pine Woods until dinner. After dinner Bernhard read Justi’s “Wincklemann”, and I read Vol. V of Creighton’s History of the Papacy.

Pineta in the morning - pier in the afternoon - a glorious balmy day. Read as above.
x Wednesday, Feb. 28, 1894, Viareggio
Pineta both morning and afternoon. I finished a Chronicle review of Leader Scott’s “Echoes of Old Florence”, and began one on Lafenestre’s Louvre Catalogue.
