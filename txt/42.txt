We spent the day with Loeser and Miss Hallowell walking to the Incontro. We took our lunch and Santayana’s just-published poems. The lunch was very good, but the poems very bad. Miss Hallowell dined with Bernhard and me at the Luna.

I took Emily and Miss Rea to see a Villa in the morning. Bernhard took the Mallets to the Uffizi, and then we dined with Emily, Miss Rea, and Fabbri at Loeser’s. Loeser was as full of  baleverines  as usual. He said that the “values” in Puvis’ portrait of himself are all wrong.

Bernhard and I called on Obrist and found a charming bust called “A Faun Listening”. We met Emily and Miss Rea in the Medici Tombs, and then had tea together. Afterwards Bernhard and I walked here. I read Mrs. Ward’s horribly trashy tale “ Marcella ”.
