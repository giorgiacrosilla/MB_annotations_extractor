I finished L’Innocente,  but did not like it [at] all. We worked on the book, and I began to write my Louvre Guide. Mr. Morgan came to dinner. We rather prize him, for he is a good representation of the old generation, and yet not “grunching”- at least to  us . Who knows what his sons will find him?

A year ago we left Florence. Today we worked on as usual, but the book did not progress much. It looks as if it could not be finished before I must go. Mr. and Mrs. Kerr-Lawson came to dinner and were nice. We had a long walk and discussed the pleasure we get from representations of movement, figures and drapery.
