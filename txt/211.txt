Letter from Michael
Michael writes (to me) one of two fine sentences: “Now I envy you (my envy is only Bunyan’s when he saw the pilgrims’ jolly in heaven - which, when I beheld, I wished myself among them - not in the least a desire to put a serpent in their midst) settling down to your hills and winter plain, double your share of stars by night, and such an amplitude of coloured air by day … I - we - find with years that the eye needs a few quite simple outlines - and the mind - how few books. The mind learns the secret, St. Francis’ secret, of holy poverty, and trips the world blithely without a sous.” She also quotes from Coleridge’s letters: “the folly of sinning against our first and pure impressions! It is the sin against our own ghost at least.”

Quiet day of work. Colnaghi’s partner came to see Bernhard on business, and he also had a long walk with Mr. Benn. I went to town to shop. I read one of Placci’s stories (printed in the Illustrazione) but alas! did not like it in any way.
