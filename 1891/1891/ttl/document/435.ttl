Of course if after such an outbreak he should say, “Forgive me for being so rough. I did not notice you were busy,” I could not hold out. But instead he blames me for being silent, calls me unsociable, complains of my beastly temper and goes off in a huff. Naturally, all this makes it more than easy for me to hold to my plan of showing displeasure when he is brutally rude!

Bernhard read Guy Mannering.

Friday and Saturday, November 17-18, 1893, Florence
Quite rainy days of reading and writing.
Went to Uffizi.
Reading Dante, Graf’s Attraverso il Cinquecento, and Ruskin.
Bernhard reading Dante and Vasari.
I began an article on the new Morelli translation.

Ray said she got mixed up with all the people she had to name. “There’s father, that’s one; Miss Clare, two; Mary, 3; Grandma Smith, 4; Grandma Costelloe, 5; Karin, 6.” “But which does thee love the best?” Without a moment’s hesitation she said, “The one that begins with M.” Then turning to Karin, “That’s Mother, you know.” The darling!
