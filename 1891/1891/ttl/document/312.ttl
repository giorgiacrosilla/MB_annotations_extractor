    rdf:value """* Friday, October 14, 1892, Hotel San Marco, Ravenna
Went to the Duomo and the Pinacoteca and the Museo Byzantino in the morning. Discovered an unfinished Ercole Roberti.
In the afternoon we drove to S. Maria di Porto Fuori, S. Apollinare in Classe, and the Rotunda [sic] (Tomb of Theodora), and went to San Vitale. Bernhard then strolled around looking at palaces while I rested.
In the evening I worked and Bernhard read Burckhardt on Romanesque architecture. I finished Vol. I of Morley’s Diderot.
It gives me a curious despair about the improvement in the lot of women, since I, who am (presumably) in the van, find it such a struggle to choose definitely between being a person and being a mother. I know that all that is personal in me, all that means self-development, real education, knowledge, enjoyment, is with Bernhard. With Ray I could not help sinking to mere instinctive motherhood, that is, with Ray and without Bernhard, the only possible present condition. Yet even knowing this with certainty, the struggle against the chains of womanhood, the inside chains, is a terribly hard one. Still, if laws were just to women, there need not be a quarter 〈of〉 the struggle.
