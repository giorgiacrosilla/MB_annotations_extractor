[in Bernhard’s hand:]
Between the Irish and the rest of the population in the U.S. particularly in the Eastern States it is bound to come to a war before fifty years are over.
[in Mary’s hand:]
Academy in the morning. In the afternoon went with Costa to the Palazzo Suira, the stair-case of which is decorated with wonderful frescoes by Pietro Longhi, of most delicious genre, Venetian “highlife”, in the wigs and powder of the day.
Then we went to the Palazzo Rezzonico (just opposite) and saw the ceiling painted by Tiepolo. It belongs to Browning’s son and his wife, and they have furnished it in exquisite taste.
Went out on the Giudecca.
