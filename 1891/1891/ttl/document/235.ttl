Yet he expects me to believe that he has the capacity for work of this kind! He often talks about the books he means to write, but more and more, as I have to judge him by what he does now in regard to the thing in hand, my heart sinks when he talks of these books. It is not that writing is the one occupation worthwhile. But it is worthwhile not to let momentary laziness and weakness interfere with what you have made up your mind it is best to do. It is so easy to find excuses, a much less clever person than B. could find a hundred reasons why the Hampton Court Guide isn’t worth writing. It would be more than easy for me to find reasons for not writing my child’s story. Indeed, it is hard to find reasons for going on! But I notice he does not encourage me to yield to pleasanter things and put the story by. The excuse is that my story may probably bring in immediate money, whereas all writing is, at any rate at first, unremunerative. He often speaks as if he thought he might make money by it in the end, but you don’t reach

It is horrible to me to take money from Frank. No doubt it is a kind of pride, but I want everyone who knows us to feel that we are able to be independent. And if we are, if one of my books succeeded, I should be sorry to have it all my work. B. had a little while ago a feeling as if he would like to show everyone that he is worth something. Well, I would like it too, and very much. I would not like it, if I thought it would be really bad for him. But alas! I feel that it would be good for him, and that it is the nicest thing for him to do, now that he no longer goes among people to give them his ideas, and especially when he makes a point of not giving them.
I feel stupid, as if I could not exactly reach the bottom of the feeling I have about this. Not I have a strong"""^^xsd:string ;
