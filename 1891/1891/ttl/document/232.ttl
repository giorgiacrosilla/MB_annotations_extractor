We went to the Palazzo Vecchio this morning and had a look all round. The Salviatis and Vasaris were awful. But to make up for all, we came at the end upon a wonderful little chapel, the private chapel of Eleanora of Toledo, decorated with marvellous frescoes by Bronzino. One of them, the drowning Pharaoh’s army in the Red Sea, had as wonderful a stretch of sunset coloured water as even Besnard could have painted! It reminded us both of Besnard. The figures, too were drawn with his delicious precision, that gives one such a sense of completeness. There is no hesitation, nothing tentative about him. What he undertakes to do, he carries through perfectly.
Then we went to the Badia, and then to the Uffizi, where we met Costa, with whom we walked back.
I had an Italian lesson.
Then the little Foote boy, and Arnold and Harold and Yvonne came, so that there was a merry party of children.
Then I went to B.’s where we had tea with Mr. and Mrs. Adams and Mr. Jenkins. Deadly!
In the evening I wrote my story and B. read Creighton.
