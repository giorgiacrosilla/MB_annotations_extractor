Then we went to the Baptistry and Libraria of the Duomo and saw the Pinturicchios and one of the books by Liberale. It was a delightful morning.
In the afternoon we went to the Poor House (to see a Balducci) and to Fonte Giusta, and then wandered about and ended up in the warm loggia of the cemetery where we watched through a long afternoon the changes of light on the hills and mountains.
I wrote the Linden Story and B. the sketch of the Venetian School for the Hampton Court Guide.
* Wednesday, March 23, 1892, Siena
