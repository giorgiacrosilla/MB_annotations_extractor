San Bartolomeo, San〈to〉 Spirito and San Giovanni, with culminatingly beautiful Lottos. We were adorably happy over them. We saw other churches, including the wonderful Tiepolos in the Colleoni Chapel, and the Lotto intarsias.
In the afternoon we saw the gallery, and had an enchanting walk up to the Castello.
Worked in the evening.
