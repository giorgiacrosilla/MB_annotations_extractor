    rdf:value """Wednesday, January 27, 1892, Florence
I took the children to school and B. went with Loeser to the Pitti.
In the afternoon I took mother and Lady Albinia to the Academy, then took tea with B., walked to San Miniato, and read Mrs. Jameson on Masaccio, Ghiberti, etc., and Crowe and Cavalcasselle.
B. wrote an interesting criticism on À Rebours by Huysmans.
In the evening we dined with the Ways and Loeser at the Toscana. In some respects it was amusing, but Mrs. Way ends by being “assonante.” She can only talk in tête a tête, which is awkward in a party of five. Besides her interests are so very different from mine. She is Gertrude minus the moral sentimentality, an improvement, but then she is worse at least as far as I am concerned, because she is so frivolous; her amusements do not interest me. I should be content not to see her again.
