On the road coming back we passed a perfectly preserved Castle with turrets and battlements and towers complete, a most picturesque building. Not mentioned in the guides!
I was very ill in the night, in horrible pain.
* Friday, October 28, 1892, Aquila d’Oro, Matelica  (Giuseppe Amici, albergatore)
“Did” Macerata with the assistance of the Canonico Bettucci whom we met in his Church of San Giovanni. He took us to a little Church, S. Maria della Misericordia, where there is a mysterious alter-piece ascribed indiscriminately to Crivelli and to Perugino! It was almost hidden by a wooden case, but we climbed up and saw what we could, and that little looked like Melozzo. This disconcerted him, as he has prepared a history of the Church which is all ready to be printed, except for the author of the picture. He came to see us off at the Station and presented us with a book he wrote to refute somebody who dared to deny that Tasso ever submitted his Gerusalemme Liberata to the Macerata Academy.
We arrived here in a perfect evening, with bright moonlight.
Unfortunately we both have colds.
