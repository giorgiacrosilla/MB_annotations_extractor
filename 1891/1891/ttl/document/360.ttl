Worked on Lotto, went to Bargello.
Walked in Cascine with Loeser in the afternoon and got caught in the rain.
I was locked out all day, but went to Bernhard’s and while he read Bosanquet
I read a dozen 18th Century essays.
Then I wrote to Lady Eastlake and he wrote to Went.
The Women’s Herald with the Ibsen article came.

Lotto, went to Uffizi and San Martino. Walked.
Read Symonds and Eastlake and Ranke.
Quarrelled out of mere silliness.
* Tuesday, February 14, 1893, My 29th birthday, Florence
Bernhard brought me a bunch of daffodils as a token of reconciliation.
Mr. Jenkins, whom we met at lunch, sent me an endless quantity of lovely violets.
Ray sent me Valentines she had painted herself, and Alys sent me a book called French Art by one Brownell, which Bernhard and I both read the same day, with mixed emotions, mostly disgust.

Loeser called to offer posthumous congratulations,"""^^xsd:string ;
