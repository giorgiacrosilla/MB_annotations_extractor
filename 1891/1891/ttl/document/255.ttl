A day of quarrels, alas! over plans and over the general tendency of children to engulf the personality of the mother, at any rate her intellect. I did a good deal of the quarrelling, perhaps all, but I thought better of it in the night. After all it is stupid of us ever to quarrel. [this text marked in the left margin in blue crayon]
We went to the Pitti and I got quite tired out.
Loeser came in completely overcome with a set attack made upon him by Juliet Temple and her chaperon Mrs. Sumner. Juliet is determined to marry him (she told Logan so), but she has too little tact to succeed. He was literally gasping for breath. Mrs. Sumner had evidently played about as creditable part as the “go-between” of a brothel.

We worked over Bernhard’s “Venetian School” and then went to the Opera del Duomo, a most enchantingly arranged little museum.
We spent all the afternoon and evening on the Venetian School and even got a few pages type-written.
Of course we made up our quarrel, and vowed never to quarrel again.
If I could only learn to be quite straight-forward things would go much more smoothly. I mean to try, at any rate.
