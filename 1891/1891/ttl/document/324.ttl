    rdf:value """beautiful, and suggesting what a Roman street may have looked like. The Loggia 〈dei Mercanti〉 was the finest reconstruction of Roman architecture Bernhard had seen. We saw too some fine terra-cottas modelled by Andrea Sansovino.
Very tired, went early to bed.
Friday, November 4, 1892, Nazionale, Cortona
Took the 8.25 train and arrived here about 9.
Found a B. della Gatta
and enjoyed the pictures and architecture as much as is possible when followed by an army of dirty, sniffing, shuffling, curious, greedy (and needy) hangers on.
In the afternoon we drove to Castiglione (Castel Fiorentino) to see B. della Gatta. I wrote this too soon, we did not go, but spent several hours instead enjoying the marvellous Signorellis in S. Niccolo.
Then I sat on the town wall and saw the sunset while Bernhard explored two of the Renaissance Churches.
We had a nice dinner at the Garibaldi.
Saturday, November 5, 1892, Belle Arti, Perugia
