And finding that opposition of any kind, even difference of opinion would produce these spells, I gradually became convinced that he was not to be treated as a reasonable being. I do not feel as if our cases were at all similar. I sold myself, as thee calls it, as much out of pity as out of a desire to keep a home for my children. Some day, if I can ever tell thee the story, I think thee will thyself say I could hardly have done differently. But for my sticking to him, I believe he would to-day have been in an insane asylum; and, with my views of duty, I could not have forsaken him on account of his health, apart from every other consideration. My life has not had only simple issues, but many complications arising from my ideas (in some respects mistaken) of duty, and from father’s health.”
