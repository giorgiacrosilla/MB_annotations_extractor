We spent the morning sight-seeing and taking notes on pictures. In the afternoon we began to write our “Correggio” for Hampton Court, and quarrelled atrociously over it!
However, after a Vermouth we were in a better temper, and it went like magic! Bernhard discovered Correggio’s “Law.” After that the interest of working it out became absorbing. We finished writing it.

Finished our notes in the Duomo, and walked out in the rain to San Giusto, but found no picture. Crowds of little boys gathered silently about us, like cherubs or putti winging about a Madonna. [marked in the left margin in blue crayon]
In the afternoon we walked to S. Girolamo, a lovely walk through lanes all fragrant with the heavy rain. We found some interesting pictures and della Robbia altar-pieces.
In the evening we printed the Bassani and Correggio.
I read Charles V and Bernhard Lorenzo de’ Medici.
