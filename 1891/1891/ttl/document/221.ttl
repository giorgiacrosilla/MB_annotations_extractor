Saw the Andrea del Sarto frescoes at the Annunziata, the Scalzo, San Salvi and the Academy.
I paid a short call on Gertrude.
After my Italian lesson I went to B.’s where I had tea and read Huysmans’ wonderful little story called “Un Dilemme”.
We walked and in the evening I read my children’s story to B. I have decided to call it Linden Stories or Summers at Linden. He was very enthusiastic, to my great delight. How I hope it may turn out to be worth while. I would like to support myself.
* Friday, February 26, 1892, Florence
I went to the tomb of the Medici in the morning.
Gertrude gave me her criticisms on our Correggio article, which she seemed to think very important, but I did not find them worth much.
After my lesson we walked nearly to the Villa Careggi.
Then came home and had tea.
B. read Creighton’s History of the Papacy  and I finished the first part of my Linden Stories. B. thought it good.
After he went, I read some of Creighton too.
