Last look at Gallery.
Bernhard found “Vernon Lee’s” card. We must have seen her in the Gallery, a fright, but seeming rather intelligent about the pictures.
I found a letter from Lady Eastlake.
We came to Genoa, hoping to find an Esposizione di Quadri Antichi to repay us.
Monday, September 26, 1892, Genoa
Went to the Brignole-Sale Gallery and found some Paris Bordones. Saw the Municipio.
Met Signor Barozzi of Venice at the Esposizione. We found very few things there to reward our journey, perhaps a portrait by Bartolommeo Veneto was the only other thing we would not naturally have seen whenever we came here.
In the afternoon I wrote to Mr. Arford, my solicitor, sending him some questions for Counsel’s opinion.
Then we went to the Palazzo Marcelli-Durazzo, and found nothing, but a fine stair-case and Guidos and Reubens, etc.
Then to the Balbi-Senegara and found an overwhelming Titian, marvellously beautiful, worth any journey!
Afterwards we saw the sunset from the town of S. Maria di Carignano.
Wrote in evening. Read Charles V.
