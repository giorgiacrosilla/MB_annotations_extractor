A heavenly day, after all the rains.
We revisited the Signorelli, saw the Cambio and saw Bernardino and scrambled about the walls.
After lunch Bernhard wrote his “Architecture”, being inspired by the fact that the “Nation” has just printed his article on Vasari, paying him £6.2/5 for it.
I finished Manette Salomon.

Then we walked with the Mikes to S. Pietro,
and round about in the country, getting endless enchanting views.
After dinner wrote.
Tuesday, May 2, 1893, Albergo della Posta, Foligno
We had a wonderful morning at Assisi.
Then Bernhard and I went to Foligno by train while “M.F.”
drove to Spello. We met at Spello, and walked out to S. Girolamo, where a nightingale was singing in the wood. Never has there been a more beautiful day.
[ROME]
Wednesday, May 3, 1893, Hotel Suisse, Rome
We got up at 4.30 and took the 5.30 train to Spoleto, where we had 4 hours of rapturous enjoyment.
Then we came here, a hot dusty journey.
