Sunday, March 27, 1892, Florence
Took Emma and the children to the Gallery in the morning. Karin was much bored. The only really delightful thing to her was climbing on the seats. Ray liked the picture stories and the two Heads of Medusa. But sculpture interested her much more, and even Karin went so far as to kiss the Boar’s snout.
In the afternoon I wrote and read to Ray and went to see Gertrude.

Both read Creighton vol. III.
Wrote my story.
