After helping Bernhard a little with his packing - over which he is about as nervous as a cat! - I did the polite 〈visit〉 to the Lady Albinia Hobart-Hampton, and got pretty much bored as a reward for my pains. She is talkable to, that is all. Still, that is a great deal when you remember how horribly hard it is to get most people to talk impersonally at all. She thought Bronzino’s pictures ‘very clever, and all that you say,’ but “so inartistic”, a curious phrase. I do wonder what “artistic” means. I suppose it is the thing people mean when they say “it is as pretty as a picture.”
Bernhard came to lunch, and we went on with his Venetian School.
Then we took a walk in the rain and had tea with Loeser, who was hiding away, having left Juliet and Mrs. Sumner under the impression that he was going to Perugia today. He said Juliet was much nicer yesterday. She had evidently changed her tactics, but too late!
A few days ago he said Mrs. Way was surrounded by a whirl of society. Now he says she sees no one, and Mr. Way keeps a jealous guard over her and won’t allow her to exercise her natural gifts for flirting. I suppose some catastrophe mild or violent has happened, as was indeed inevitable with such"""^^xsd:string ;
