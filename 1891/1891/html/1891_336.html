		<p>the Opera del Duomo.</p>
		<p>We worked on our Quadri and nearly brought it up to date.</p>
		<p>I began Geymüller’s book on Bramante and St. Peter’s.</p>
		<p>Bernhard is reading Machiavelli’s Storia Fiorentina and also the Sacco di Roma, both of which he says are simply fascinating.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, November 29, 1892, 14 Lungarno Accaij〈u〉oli, Florence</p>
		<p>B. read an article on “The Next Conclave” to me while I arranged photographs.</p>
		<p>We finished our work on the Quadri and read until lunch time.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon Bernhard took a long walk with Mr. Jenkins, and they both came back to tea. Jenkins said a man could live very comfortably here in Florence on £50 a year.</p>
		<p>I finished Geymüller, and Bernhard lost himself in Burd’s edition of Il Principe.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, November 30, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I read a play of Ibsen’s Lady Inger of Ostrat,</p>
		<p>but did not see anything in it.</p>
		<p>Went to the Duomo and the Sacristy.</p>
		<p>Costa came in the afternoon, and was very nice.</p>
