The well-known form, the reserve and dignity, and tested appropriateness more than make up for the originality in the other - e.g., this is my comparison, not Bernhardâ€™s! Then we went to the Baptistry and Libraria of the Duomo and saw the Pinturicchios and one of the books by Liberale. It was a delightful morning.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we went to the Poor House (to see a Balducci) and to Fonte Giusta, and then wandered about and ended up in the warm loggia of the cemetery where we watched through a long afternoon the changes of light on the hills and mountains.</p>
		<p>I wrote the Linden Story and B. the sketch of the Venetian School for the Hampton Court Guide.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, March 23, 1892, Siena</p>
		<p>Went to the Municipio to see especially the Beccafumis. How surprisingly modern some of them are!</p>
		<p>Then to the Poor House to see a fresco of Beccafumi that Signor Frizzoni wrote to Bernhard about, asking if it might be a Peruzzi.</p>
		<p>Then to the Gallery, where we delighted in the charming Beccafumi, St. Catherine receiving the stigmata. Also the Paris Bordone.</p>
