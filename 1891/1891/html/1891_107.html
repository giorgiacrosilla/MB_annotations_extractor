		<p>Thursday, September 3, 1891, Hotel Roth, MÃ¼nchen</p>
		<p>From Regensberg to Munich 8.18 - 11.45. Read Faust all the way.</p>
		<p>The Pinacothek from 1-2, just a glance at the Italian pictures. How lovely the Francia, and how matchless the Titian. Morelli compares it to the last works of Franz Hals. The Sodoma was delightful, and a small Correggio.</p>
		<p>We were both secretly dying [sic] to get to the exhibition of modern French (and other) pictures, so, after a rest, we went to the Glaspalast and found some of our favourites of the Salon, as well as some new ones. Three Monets there, and four or five Manets, besides a new Besnard</p>
		<p>and two new Dagnau-Bouverets</p>
