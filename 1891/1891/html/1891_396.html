		<p>Saw the Signorelli.</p>
		<p>A “camora” was made to prevent our getting anything but a miserable two wheeled, rope-bottomed trap to take us to Perugia, but Bernhard saw through it, and in the end we got a nice phaeton, and came here in 3 hours, paying 15 francs.</p>
		<p>The Mikes were already here, and we dined together at the “Progresso”.</p>
		<p>Sunday, April 30, 1893, Perugia</p>
		<p>Duomo. Belle Arti with Mikes.</p>
