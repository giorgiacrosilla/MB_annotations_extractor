		<p>Thursday, November 2, 1893, Brescia, Capello</p>
		<p>Missed the train to Medole, so spent a delightful day seeing the churches.</p>
		<p>At S. Clemente we got into a quarrel with the custode and the parroco, and at the end came to mutual vituperation. “Senza Creanza” was the last word hurled at us as we disappeared round the corner.</p>
		<p>Bernhard read Il Cortigiano  and I wrote in the evening.</p>

		<p>Spent 2 1/4 hours going to Medole,</p>
