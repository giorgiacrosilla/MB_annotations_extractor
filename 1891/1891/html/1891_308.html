		<p>Wednesday, October 5, 1892, Albergo Monaco, Venice</p>
		<p>Met Sperrys at 10, and went with them to San Salvador, San Giovanni Grisostomo, Santi Apostoli, San Felice, Santa Maria del Orto, and the Gesuiti. They are rather desolating; they want to get out of a church the instant they have looked about once, particularly the mother, who does not revere Bernhard’s opinion as the daughter does.</p>
		<p>After lunch we went to the Palazzo Grassi and saw the incomparable Longhis.</p>
		<p>They are such kindly comments on his own day, full of genial sympathy with all its amusements and foibles. There is no trace of haughtiness or sternness. He is in a way Hogarth’s double, but with sympathy instead of satire. His figures are all loveable, sweet, gracious, really aristocratic. As painting, it is really superb, and I know nowhere finer decoration. The harmony of colour is delicious, all kept in as perfect tone as a modern master.</p>
		<p>After seeing them, we went to the Carmine and the Scuola, and then home by the Lagoon.</p>
		<p>In the evening we all went out to hear the singing under the Rialto. It was full moon.</p>
		<p>Thursday, October 6, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>A rainy day.</p>
		<p>We met the Sperrys in San Marco and went to the Palazzo Reale and the Correr, but it was really too dark to see anything</p>
