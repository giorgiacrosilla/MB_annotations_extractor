		<p>A letter from mother this morning unwell says that Marion Lawrence</p>
		<p>has gone crazy in Paris and that Logan brought her off to London. She proposed to a young man and declares she is engaged to him, and talks constantly of him, and of herself, saying that she is a genius, a Princess, that she is going to be a very brilliant woman, etc., etc. Mother says it is most pitiful.</p>
		<p>Ray sent me a birthday letter.</p>
		<p>Bernhard went to lunch at “Vernon Lee’s” to meet Miss Sellers.</p>
		<p>He enjoyed himself very much, and was especially interested to find Miss Sellars [sic] employing exactly the same scientific methods in her study of Greek sculpture that we use in our work.</p>
		<p>We finished the Lotto Introduction.</p>
		<p>* Sunday, February 19, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Wrote out notes on the March of Ancona for Mrs. Bywater.</p>
		<p>After lunch Bernhard met Vernon Lee & Co. at the Bargello. Vernon Lee was ready to kill him for his anti-genius notions of art. Miss Sellars [sic] said that it struck her that, as compared with the Greeks, Renaissance sculptors did not know what to do with the legs. He said they were so</p>
