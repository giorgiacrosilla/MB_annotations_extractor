		<p>Saturday, February 27, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Looked at Pontormo and Bronzino in the Pitti and Uffizi.</p>
		<p>Coming home I met Edith Kendall who asked me to dine.</p>
		<p>I took tea with B. and then went on. On the whole, I was bored. I was never very much Edith’s friend, and now I feel as if we had very little in common. She is travelling with an awful brother. She looks very fat and middle-aged, with yellow wrinkles about her eyes. I wonder if I look as old and commonplace to her?! No doubt. Well, I’m not, I know.</p>
		<p>I went back to B.’s at 9 and found he had had a call from Musgrave.</p>
		<p>Read Maupassant’s Clair de lune.</p>
		<p>There is no doubt that Huysmans’ simple story “Un Dilemme” makes Maupassant’s seems very “prepared”, almost melodramatic.</p>
		<p>Sunday, February 28, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Galleries closed.</p>
		<p>Went to see Rossi at San Lorenzo.</p>
		<p>Met Costa on our way back and he came to fix my type-writer, which had gone wrong. He stayed all the morning. It wasted some time, but on the whole we were glad to see that he was in no way angry.</p>
