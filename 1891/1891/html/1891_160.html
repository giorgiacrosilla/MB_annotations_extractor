		<p>Thursday, November 5, 1891, Hotel Tegetthof, Vienna</p>
		<p>We met the Costas on the train at 7.50 and came on to Vienna, reaching it at 9.30. The carriages were comfortable and the scenery marvellous, and we enjoyed ourselves very much.</p>
		<p>We read Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s Nouveau Monde</p>
		<p>and Flaubert’s Trois Contes.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Giovanni had sweets, which served to beguile the journey.</p>
