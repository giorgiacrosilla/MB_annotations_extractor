		<p>* Saturday, May 13, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Rospigliosi and Colonna in the morning and Borghese in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>Dead tired again!</p>
		<p>Sunday, May 14, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Spent the day at Tivoli with Miss Bliss, and came home pretty tired.</p>
		<p>Monday, May 15, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Unwell. Went to the Farnesina and Corsini.</p>
		<p>After lunch Bernhard took me to see Donna Laura Minghetti’s wonderful Leonardo (1493) - on the whole, the loveliest picture I have ever seen.</p>
		<p>Then Michael and Field and I went to S. Pietro in Vincoli. The “Moses” overwhelmed us, that horrible “Thou Shalt Not”.</p>
		<p>Then to S. Clemente, S. Stefano Rotondo, S. Pietro Montorio, S. Onofrio and so home.</p>
		<p>Their last volume, A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, came, and we read it and talked much about it. Bernhard advised them to give up Drama and stick to impressions.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, May 16, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>We finished the “Word for Renaissance Churches”.</p>
		<p>Field was most helpful. She has a splendid “thinker” and an equally good “feeler”.</p>
		<p>Went</p>
