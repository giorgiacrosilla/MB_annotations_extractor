		<p>Sunday, February 7, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>We met at the Academy and looked at the Pesellino and Botticellis. But I was feeling too ill to do much, so we came back.</p>
		<p>I read in the Galignani of a woman who domiciled herself in South Dakota in order to get a divorce, so I wrote to Emma Brayton for full information on the subject.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we took a walk and quarrelled dreadfully. When B. begins to talk to me of my family and my relations to them, I behave like the cuttle fish which when it is attacked, squirts out an inky liquid and makes everything murky around it. (Or to be more accurate, like the skunk!) Then he gets angry and we say horrid things.</p>
		<p>We dined apart, I was so cross. But I employed the time well in writing home a personal “declaration of independence”.</p>
		<p>B. dined at Loeser’s with Sumner.</p>
		<p>* Monday, February 8, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>We love each other too much to stay quarrelled, and on the whole we are both, especially</p>
