		<p>x Tuesday, September 20, 1892, Albergo Italia, Bergamo</p>
		<p>Moved here for quiet.</p>
		<p>Spent an hour in San Bartolommeo looking at the Lotto.</p>
		<p>After lunch read our article on Lotto, rested, and went to Gallery.</p>
		<p>Finished Oliver Cromwell and Liaisons Dangereuses.</p>
		<p>Wrote letters in evening.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, September 21, 1892, Bergamo</p>
		<p>Saw the Picinelli collection in the morning. Madame Picinelli was charmingly affable, such a lovely house, such pictures, her children, her own two nice daughters, money, respectability. I was tempted to envy her, but was saved by that spirit in us which makes us reason things about till we become equal to anyone.</p>
		<p>Then we went to San Spirito, and after lunch to the Gallery where we wrote a good deal of our article on the Morelli Collection.</p>
		<p>In the evening we wrote and Bernhard finished Liaisons dangereuses and I read Mrs. Creighton’s Sir Walter Rale〈i〉gh.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Thursday, September 22, 1892, Bergamo</p>
		<p>A very black day on account of our worries. But we did enjoy writing in the Gallery</p>
