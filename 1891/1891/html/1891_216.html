		<p>Friday, February 19, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Looked at Fra Bartolommeo drawings in the Uffizi and at the Andrea del Sarto’s.</p>
		<p>B. had a letter from Ned Warren saying that he could only give him one hundred pounds more, in the middle of May. It was a very nice letter, although it conveyed bad news. Still it is something to have that £100.</p>
		<p>Afterwards we came home and talked over our plans very seriously. B. decided not to leave Italy this summer.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon he went to see Mme Villari, and I went to see Gertrude.</p>
		<p>Then we looked at photographs <of> Michelangelo, the Ferrarese, and the later Florentines.</p>
		<p>We were both sleepy in the evening, so we did not do much except discuss our plans, which are indeed somewhat hard to arrange!</p>
		<p>I am reading an Italian translation of Tourghenieff’s Assia  with my teacher, Mme Zucchelli.</p>
		<p>x Saturday, February 20, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I went to B.’s and darned some of his stockings.</p>
		<p>Then we went to Alinari’s and looked over photographs. Costa joined us. He wanted me to come and meet the Countess</p>
