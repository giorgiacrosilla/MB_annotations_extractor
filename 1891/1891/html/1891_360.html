		<p>Bernhard brought me a bunch of daffodils as a token of reconciliation.</p>
		<p>Mr. Jenkins, whom we met at lunch, sent me an endless quantity of lovely violets.</p>
		<p>Ray sent me Valentines she had painted herself, and Alys sent me a book called French Art by one Brownell, which Bernhard and I both read the same day, with mixed emotions, mostly disgust.</p>
