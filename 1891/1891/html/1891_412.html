		<p>Bernardino da Mariotto.</p>
		<p>Came on to Nancy, and saw the Musée, etc. The director, a head guardian, was such a nice man, with lovely eyes. We discovered a Lotto! and a B. Veneto.</p>
		<p>Read Docteur Pascal.</p>
		<p>In England we read 3 volumes of Ranke’s History of England. I read Philippson’s Contro-Revolution and Rudyard Kipling. Bernhard 〈read〉 Philippson’s Louis XIV and the Apocrypha.</p>
		<p>* Friday, August 18, 1893, Pfeiffer, Strassburg</p>
		<p>Reached here about 1.30. Went to Museum and discovered 2 Carianis</p>
		<p>and a Beccafumi. Saw the Cathedral. It made an immense impression at first, and then we were disappointed. It is so barbarous compared to those we have been seeing. The Romanesque choir with the cupola, however, we enjoyed. We did not like the façade.</p>
		<p>Hot!</p>
		<p>Saturday, August 19, 1893, Oberpollinger, Stuttgart</p>
		<p>Reached here 12.45. Awfully hot.</p>
		<p>Saw Gallery and were overcome with the badness of the Italian</p>
