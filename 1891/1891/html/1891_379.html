		<p>Sunday, March 19, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Went to the Academy and San Marco. Bernhard and Christina went to the Pazzi frescoes while I came home.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon they walked over Bellosguardo and I read The Vicar of Wakefield.</p>
		<p>Talked all evening.</p>
		<p>Monday, March 20, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Santa Maria Novella.</p>
		<p>Worked over Lotto. Christina explored for herself. We read her our “Lotto”, and she confessed to having thought of Titian as a “sort of Dutchman.” Lionardo only suggested “a long kind of a Madonna and angel”; of Tintoretto and Botticelli she had never heard.</p>
