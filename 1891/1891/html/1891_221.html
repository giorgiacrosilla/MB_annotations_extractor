		<p>Thursday, February 25, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Saw the Andrea del Sarto frescoes at the Annunziata, the Scalzo, San Salvi and the Academy.</p>
		<p>I paid a short call on Gertrude.</p>
		<p>After my Italian lesson I went to B.’s where I had tea and read Huysmans’ wonderful little story called “Un Dilemme”.</p>
		<p>We walked and in the evening I read my children’s story to B. I have decided to call it Linden Stories or Summers at Linden. He was very enthusiastic, to my great delight. How I hope it may turn out to be worth while. I would like to support myself.</p>
		<p>* Friday, February 26, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I went to the tomb of the Medici in the morning.</p>
		<p>Gertrude gave me her criticisms on our Correggio article, which she seemed to think very important, but I did not find them worth much.</p>
		<p>After my lesson we walked nearly to the Villa Careggi.</p>
		<p>Then came home and had tea.</p>
		<p>B. read Creighton’s History of the Papacy  and I finished the first part of my Linden Stories. B. thought it good.</p>
		<p>After he went, I read some of Creighton too.</p>
