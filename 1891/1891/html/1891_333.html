		<p>strength of it all, and the beauty of some of the episodes.</p>
		<p>Wrote my article on Assisi.</p>
		<p>Bernhard still reading Burckhardt on Architecture.</p>
		<p>Bernhard had a splendid walk.</p>
		<p>* Saturday, November 19, 1892, Orvieto</p>
		<p>Cathedral in the morning.</p>
		<p>I was tired and rested and wrote all the afternoon, finishing my article, while Bernhard had another beautiful walk.</p>
		<p>The town rests like the Ark on the top of huge rocks. The Signorellis please me more.</p>
		<p>Sunday, November 20, 1892, Orvieto</p>
		<p>I managed to walk around the town a little to see the views and some churches and palaces, etc. Then we went to the Duomo.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon I sat in the sun on the wall, while Bernhard walked to the Campo Santo, etc.</p>
		<p>I finished Gardiner’s Thirty Years’ War, and Bernhard finished Burckhardt.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed the Signorellis most of all today.</p>

		<p>Monday, November 21, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Had a last look at the Cathedral before coming away. Mass was being gorgeously sung, with a a congregation of three or four old women and men. What a contrast to a Protestant service, where everything depends on the audience and the newspapers’ report, so to speak. The Mass carries on the real tradition of sacrifice and worship.</p>
