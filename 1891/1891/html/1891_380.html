		<p>Tuesday, March 21, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Took Christina to the Uffizi. The Florentines left her cold.</p>
		<p>We took a long walk in the afternoon in the Fiesole hills.</p>
		<p>Read The Wild Duck in the evening, which depressed Bernhard still more, as he compared himself and his Great Work in futuro to Hialmar and his “Invention”.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, March 22, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Took Christina to the Pitti, and here, before the Venetians, especially Tintoretto, she waked up. Her criticism was delightful. “How it sticks out”, which put into the Art Critics’ pompoferous language means “How solidly it is modelled, how well the values are given, what ‘atmosphere’.” The great Art Critic of the future will be the one who dares to say “stick out” (and who has money to publish his own books!!)</p>
