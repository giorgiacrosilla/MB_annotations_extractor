		<p>* Thursday, February 16, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>We worked on our Lotto.</p>
		<p>After lunch we walked around by Carreggi [sic] to San Domenico across the fields. It was very hot.</p>
		<p>Mr. Jenkins came to tea. He told us of his experience as his father’s election agent in Cornwall, which gave him such a horror of politics that he would not say a word about Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill. Talk of the electorate being pure!! On the whole I think it was purer to b〈u〉y votes by playing on people’s avarice than upon their snobbishness.</p>

		<p>Bernhard called on Senator Comparetti whom he found editing the earliest Code, a Cretan tablet dating from about 600 B.C.</p>
		<p>After lunch we walked over the Bellosguardo hills and then came back and grappled with our Introduction to Lotto.</p>
		<p>Bernhard was rather cast down at discovering what a treacherous friend Loeser is. It came out in this way. The picture-dealer</p>
