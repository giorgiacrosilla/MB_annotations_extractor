		<p>Ray said she got mixed up with all the people she had to name. “There’s father, that’s one; Miss Clare, two; Mary, 3; Grandma Smith, 4; Grandma Costelloe, 5; Karin, 6.” “But which does thee love the best?” Without a moment’s hesitation she said, “The one that begins with M.” Then turning to Karin, “That’s Mother, you know.” The darling!</p>
