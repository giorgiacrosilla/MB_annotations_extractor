		<p>Tuesday, September 8, 1891, Munich – Verona</p>
		<p>Milanese and Ferrarese Schools in the Gallery in the morning.</p>
		<p>B. lunched with Mr. Marshall.</p>
		<p>I read Charles V  and packed.</p>
		<p>Went to the International Exhibition in the afternoon. On the whole, we liked best the Besnard sunset over the water.</p>
