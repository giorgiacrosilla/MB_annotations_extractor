		<p>Worked on our Lotto all day long.</p>
		<p>Thursday, January 26, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Prof. James called on Bernhard and we all went to the Uffizi together. James is the greatest bore to show pictures to. He seems to think they are to be taken in by any sense except the sense of sight, “particularly by the ears”, as Bernhard says, and he particularly and persistently admires all the very worst daubs. For instance, in the room of the Giorgiones he liked most that horrid Salviati affair (called Paolo) of a woman washing her feet!</p>
		<p>After lunch Bernhard took a walk with Loeser, who came back to tea and took us to dine with him.</p>
		<p>I felt rather ill, with a cold coming on.</p>

		<p>Mr. and Mrs. James came to go to the Gallery. James was as scatter-brained and inappropriate as ever, but Mrs.</p>
