		<p>Monday, May 2, 1892, Hotel Pellegrino, Bologna [an * deleted]</p>
		<p>Arrived at Florence 10.30.</p>
		<p>Bank, etc., etc.</p>
		<p>Said goodbye to Gertrude. It was hard to listen to her vapourings about Julia’s “sympathy with childhood,” etc., etc., when all the women of the Pension had besieged me on the stairs to tell me that Julia was very cruel and kept the children crying all day long!</p>
		<p>We came on at 2.30 to Bologna, with some nice Americans, and had a little look around the splendid town.</p>
		<p>* Tuesday, May 3, 1892, Bologna</p>
		<p>Churches in the morning and the gallery in the afternoon. Then a little rest (for I was dead tired) and another stroll. Saw Palazzo Bevilacqua.</p>
		<p>Bernhard is reading Michelet’s History of France,</p>
		<p>the volume on the Renaissance. I am reading Symonds’ Catholic Reaction.</p>
		<p>Finished our Titian in the evening.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, May 4, 1892, Bologna</p>
		<p>Went to Ferrara for the day to see the gallery and an exhibition of pictures from private collections. This was all worth seeing as it made us acquainted with Coltellini, and there was a splendid Tura among them.</p>
		<p>Bernhard went</p>
