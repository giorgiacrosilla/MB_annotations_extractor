		<p>That the Moretto is a Moretto, and not a Moroni.</p>
		<p>Looked at the Dürer engravings.</p>
		<p>After quarrelled slightly and then walked in the Park.</p>
		<p>Saturday, September 5, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich</p>
		<p>We took the 7 o’clock train to Augsburg. I read Faust all the way.</p>
		<p>Wandered about the town and saw the Cathedral. The stained glass windows of the 11th century mentioned by Baedeker exist only in his imagination. Cathedral filled with altar-pictures by German masters, best seemed to be by Burckmeyer.</p>
		<p>At 9 went to the gallery and looked at the Italian pictures there. The most beautiful was a Tintoretto.</p>
