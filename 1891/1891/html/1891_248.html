		<p>Thursday, March 31, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi in the morning. Bernhard met Mrs. Bywater.</p>
		<p>I felt very ill. We read and loafed all the afternoon. I went to bed feeling ill.</p>
		<p>In the evening we dined with Loeser and he took us to the Opera to hear Saint-Saëns’ Sansone e Dalila, which was really good.</p>
		<p>Friday, April 1, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi in the morning.</p>
		<p>B. came to lunch and wrote his Venetian introduction here, while I slept, again feeling ill. I had an awful headache during the afternoon and evening.</p>
		<p>* Saturday, April 2, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I took the children to be photographed and then joined Bernhard in the Pitti.</p>
		<p>He had a letter from his friend which, after much discussion, turned the scales in favour of his going on to Paris. It made me feel very happy, for I hated to think of his missing the Salon. It doesn’t pay to miss a whole year of the wonderful time in France. The decline is likely to begin at almost any time. O I am very happy to think he is going! We each did our own writing in the afternoon, and then took a short walk together.</p>
		<p>In the evening we went over our Mantegna</p>
