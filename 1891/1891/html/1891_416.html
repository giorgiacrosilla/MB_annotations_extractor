		<p>Wednesday, August 30</p>
		<p>Gallery in the morning.</p>
		<p>Wrote and walked in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>Thursday, August 31, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Somehow I have skipped a date and it is the 31st. I don’t understand it! The programme of the day was as usual.</p>
		<p>Friday, September 1, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Stayed in and wrote “Giant” and Hampton Court Guide.</p>
		<p>Went to hear Tannhäuser which we enjoyed immensely, rather to our surprise. It is a very generous young work. He didn’t economize themes and situations.</p>
		<p>Saturday, September 2, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Gallery, walked, and wrote as usual.</p>
		<p>Sunday, September 3, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Eight years ago was my marriage-day, alas!</p>
		<p>We tried to go to Schleis〈s〉heim,</p>
		<p>but the train stopped running Sept. 1. So we went to the Gallery.</p>
		<p>After writing and a walk we heard Das Rheingold</p>
