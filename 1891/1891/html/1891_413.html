		<p>pictures. Did a lot of renaming.</p>
		<p>Wandered about the town. Read Ranke. Wrote letters.</p>
		<p>[MUNICH]</p>
		<p>Sunday, August 20, 1893, Hotel Roth, Munich</p>
		<p>Gallery again, still rather depressing. Discovered a Cariani</p>
		<p>and 2 Giulio Campis, etc.</p>
		<p>Wandered in the lovely parks.</p>
		<p>Left for Munich at 1.54. Went out at Ulm to see the Cathedral and missed the train. Stopped our luggage by telegram at one of the stations, and had a couple of hours to see the town, before taking a train to rejoin it.</p>
		<p>Reached Munich 10.30.</p>
		<p>Monday, August 21, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Changed rooms. They have no blinds in this hotel and the light enters at 4!</p>
		<p>Went to the Gallery, and to hear “Die Walküre” in the evening. Decided that it needs condensing, except the last act. I noticed a “digestion motif” which I think no one has pointed out. It occurs when Sigmund drinks, and represents the bier [sic] gurgling down his throat and rumbling about in his stomach and intestines!</p>
