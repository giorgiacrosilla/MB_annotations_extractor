		<p>saw the Missal of Cardinal della Rovere with miniatures by some painter extraordinarily close to the author of Lady Eastlake’s little pictures. Found an Antonio Vivarini there too.</p>
		<p>After a rest, we went to the Cathedral.</p>
		<p>Wrote to Lady Eastlake after dinner.</p>
		<p>Saturday, September 17, 1892,  Hotel della Croce Bianca, Varallo</p>
		<p>Left Turin 8.30 and reached Novara at 10.30. Saw the Gaudenzio</p>
		<p>in San Gaudenzio, and in the Duomo, also the Lavinis.</p>
		<p>Came on to Varallo at 1.10 reaching here about 4. Took a peep at the Gaudenzios.</p>
		<p>Bernhard was not so much enchanted by them as he was two years ago.</p>
		<p>I was rather disconsolate with sore-throat and general dilapidation.</p>
		<p>Bernhard read 〈Diderot’s〉 Le neveau de Rameau  and I read 〈Diderot’s〉 Jacques le Fataliste et son Maître.</p>
		<p>x Sunday, September 18, 1892, Varallo</p>
		<p>Finished Jacques le fataliste after enjoying it almost as much as Sterne’s Sentimental Journey.</p>
		<p>Bernhard read 〈Potapenko’s〉 Le Roman d’un homme raisonnable.</p>
		<p>He finds in the author, Potapen[c]ko, the influence of Ibsen.</p>
		<p>We went in the morning to San Francesco and studied the frescoes. Then we took a walk up the mountain stream, and I had a delicious swim in a deep green pool, and a sun-bath on a secluded beach.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we walked out to San Marco in the hope of finding my opera glasses which I had left on a seat outside</p>
