		<p>fine, mild weather.</p>
		<p>The last part of the afternoon we spent in the Eremitani before the Mantegna frescoes.</p>
		<p>B. was awfully sick in the night.</p>
		<p>Friday, October 30, 1891, Padua</p>
		<p>We spent the day at Vicenza, but did not have time to enjoy Palladio very much, because there were so many pictures to be seen. It was a day to be remembered by me, because I first became aware of Mantegna as a really great painter. There was also a fine Buonconsiglio</p>
