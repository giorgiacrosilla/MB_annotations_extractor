		<p>Tuesday, October 17, 1893, Croce d’Oro, Padua</p>
		<p>Horrors of packing all the morning. Reached here 3.30. Strolled about the town.</p>
		<p>I discovered a Fil. da Verona  in the Duomo!</p>
		<p>I wrote my Hampton Court <Guide>, and Bernhard read Crowe & Cavalcaselle on Padua in the evening.</p>
		<p>I was not very well.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, October 18, 1893, Croce d’Oro, Padua</p>
		<p>Gallery in the morning.</p>
		<p>We went to Pieve</p>
		<p>in the afternoon to see a (ruined) Alvise.</p>
		<p>Found a Tiepolo and a curious Palma-Romanino alter-piece by a certain “Venetus” whose name we could not make out: “Giov. Pen- or Per- silinus”.</p>
		<p>Read Ranke and Mantova e Urbino by Luzio and Renier.</p>
		<p>Thursday, October 19, 1893, Croce d’Oro, Padua</p>
		<p>Bernhard with a cold and diarrhoea and I still unwell from some cause to me incomprehensible.</p>
		<p>We saw the Bishop’s Palace, Duomo, Baptistry and Eremitani in the morning, and drove to Stra in the afternoon (5.50) only to find the reported Tiepolo false. Still the Palace is magnificent.</p>
		<p>I wrote on my Hampton Court <Guide> and Bernhard, lying on the sofa, read all the evening.</p>
		<p>The first day of autumn.</p>
		<p>Friday, October 20, 1893, Croce d’Oro, Padua</p>
		<p>Bernhard was taken awfully ill in the night with pains, etc., and a cold sweat that made us think</p>
