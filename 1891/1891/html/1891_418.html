		<p>dreadful time finding rooms, for the town is crowded, and has been since June 4, with a Fair. One hotel keeper said he could not give us 3 single rooms, but he could give us one room with 3 beds! That man deserves to succeed in his business!!!</p>
		<p>Sunday, September 10, 1893, * Hotel dâ€™Ampezzo, Toblach</p>
		<p>Saw the Gallery, etc. Came here.</p>
		<p>[TRENTINO - ALTO ADIGE - VENETO]</p>
		<p>Monday, September 11, 1893, * Aquila Nera, Cortina</p>
		<p>Diligence to Schluderbach. Then we walked through the Dolomites here, about 15/16 miles. We enjoyed every step of the way, all three of us. It was a thoroughly delightful day.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, September 12, 1893, Hotel Venezia, Pieve di Cadore</p>
		<p>Diligence to Barca, walked to Venas. There I took the post here, but Hapgood and Berenson walked. I went to another hotel from the one arranged, and failed to catch them on the way, so they had a tiresome hunt. Bernhard was very cross.</p>
		<p>Saw the Church, etc.</p>
