		<p>Friday, May 19, 1893, San Benedetto del Tronto</p>
		<p>Left Rome at 7 o’clock. The journey across the mountains, from crater to crater, was wonderful. We found this quiet little place by the sea and settled here for the night instead of going on to Ascoli.</p>
		<p>Saturday, May 20, 1893, Albergo Vittoria, Fermo</p>
		<p>Saw Ascoli and the Crivelli in the Duomo there.</p>
		<p>Came here, a fascinating evening drive from the station. Wonderful white wine.</p>
		<p>Sunday, May 21, 1893, Fermo</p>
		<p>Drove, 7.30-11, to Massa Fermana and found a Crivelli. A wonderful drive.</p>
		<p>Fermo a tiny quiet place without even a Caffé or a Trattoria! But some people took us in and gave us eggs and curds and brown bread, and we got on very well.</p>
		<p>Monday, May 22, 1893, Albergo Pellegrino, Loreto</p>
		<p>Saw Fermo and made the acquaintance of the Bibliotecario “Marchese Filippo Cav. Raffaelli”.</p>
		<p>Discovered a Rondinelli in a Church, and 2 Bartolomeo Vivarinis and a Savoldo in the Palazzo Bernetti.</p>
		<p>Then we drove to Torre di Palma, but found the so-called Crivelli a fraud, that is to say, a Vittorio Crivelli.</p>
		<p>Then we came</p>
