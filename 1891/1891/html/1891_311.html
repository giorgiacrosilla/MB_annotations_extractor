		<p>Tuesday, October 11, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>My money came, but less than half of what I expected, which cast a gloom over our plans and over us.</p>
		<p>We went to S. Zaccaria to negociate [sic] about an old picture frame we went to get for Burke.</p>
		<p>Then we went to the Seminario, and I being tired came in, while Bernhard went to the Doge’s Palace.</p>
		<p>After lunch we went to the Academy.</p>
		<p>Then Bernhard concluded his purchase of the frame and I added to my book, which I shall call “The Book”.</p>
		<p>Read Robertson and Eastlake.</p>
		<p>Bernhard wrote to Maude.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, October 12, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>Gallery in morning and Doge’s Palace in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>Bernhard sent off the frame to Burke after much trouble.</p>
		<p>I finished Charles V.</p>
		<p>Packed and wrote in the evening.</p>
		<p>[ROMAGNA, LE MARCHE, TUSCANY, UMBRIA]</p>
		<p>Thursday, October 13, 1892, Hotel San Marco, Ravenna</p>
		<p>Arrived in Padua at 10. Saw Santa Giustina and the splendid Paolo,</p>
		<p>the Santo, and the Gallery. Then Bernhard discovered an Alvise Vivarini, and I a Licinio. He also found that Speranza’s pictures (last year’s attributions) were done by Filippo da Verona, a sad discovery!</p>
		<p>Then we went to the Arena and saw the Giottos and came in by the 3 o’clock train, arriving at 7.30.</p>
		<p>I read Morley’s Diderot, written in a vulgar newspaper style, but very interesting.</p>
