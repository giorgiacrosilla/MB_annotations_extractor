		<p>Friday, August 14, 1891</p>
		<p>Read Motley going to Haarlem.</p>
		<p>Spent 2 1/2 hours in the Museum, studying Frans Hals, etc. We were perfectly fascinated with the two pictures nos. 77 & 78, painted in 1664 in a manner suggestive of Zorn and Carri√®re, but even more modern than either! Compared him to Shakspeare. Also found figures and treatment which Rembrandt must have copied.</p>
		<p>The best Terburg, a Family Group, was painted very much like a Courtois. A landscape by Van der Velde was like a Hampstead Heath scene by Constable, but better! The Cornelius van Haarlems were all</p>
