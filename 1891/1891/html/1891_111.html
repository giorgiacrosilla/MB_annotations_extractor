		<p>After the gallery we visited the other Churches and looked at the picturesque parts of the town. Then had an excellent lunch at the “Grün Haus” and came back by a slow train, sleeping and reading Villiers de Lisle Adam’s Le Secret de l’Échafaud.</p>

		<p>Tried to re-write Correggio article.</p>
		<p>Sunday, September 6, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich</p>
		<p>Went to the Pinacothek and studied and noted the Venetian and Veronese paintings.</p>
		<p>Visited the various Brauereis in the evening, but they were so smoky that even the music did not tempt us to stay.</p>
		<p>As it was a Volksfest, a cold rain was falling all day. God is evidently as undemocratic here as in England!</p>
