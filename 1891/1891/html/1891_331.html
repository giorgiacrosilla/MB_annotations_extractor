		<p>Tuesday, November 15, 1892, Grandori, Viterbo</p>
		<p>Left Terni at 8, reaching Orte at 9.</p>
		<p>Drove here, a very wonderful drive on the edge of the Cinimian forest, in a Claude-Poussin landscape.</p>
		<p>On the way we stopped to see the * Villa Lante at Bagnaia (4 kilometres from Viterbo) The architecture was most interesting, being a cross between the Farnesina and the Palazzo del TÃ¨, perhaps Raphael, or Giulio Romano young, or could it have been Vignola? Whoever it was, it was very fine. Hundreds of fountains and running streams splashed about. The basins and urns and terraces, etc., were all fine and strong, evidently the work of a great artist.</p>
		<p>Then we stopped to see the Madonna della Quercia (of 1538, Paul III) with its fine Bramante tower, and early Renaissance interior, and two most interesting cloisters.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon looked at the Sebastiano del Piombo in the Pinacoteca and saw the Duomo, etc.</p>
		<p>Found a really good restaurant, the Schenardi.</p>
		<p>Quarrelled.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, November 16, 1892, Grandori, Viterbo</p>
