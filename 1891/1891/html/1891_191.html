		<p>the evening we rewrote our Bonifazio.</p>
		<p>Saturday, January 16, 1892. Florence</p>
		<p>Finished the Venetians in the Pitti.</p>
		<p>B. went to see Costa and I to see Gertrude.</p>
		<p>He did not come to dinner, and I read Vol. I of Yriarte’s César Borgia.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>B. invented the word “Pruritanic.” He went to hear Le Barbre de Seville with Loeser.</p>
		<p>Sunday, January 17, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Bargello in the morning.</p>
		<p>Tea with Loeser at 24 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Bernhard’s room, after the two had been to call on the Ways, a proceeding which they compared to a Turkish Bath. Bernhard said that Mrs. Way sighed delightfully. Loeser was rather nice.</p>
		<p>In the evening I read Layard and Crowe and Cavalcaselle on Lorenzo Monaco, and Prescott’s description of Charles VIII in Italy.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Missed Bernhard.</p>
