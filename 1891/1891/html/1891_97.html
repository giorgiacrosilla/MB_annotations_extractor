		<p>* 〈Sunday〉 August 30, 1891, Dresden</p>
		<p>Took 9.20 train to Pötscha and walked to the Bastei through fresh, mushroom smelling pine woods.</p>
		<p>After lunch we started to walk to Shaudan but took a cul-de-sac road which landed us in a beautiful woodland temple. Walked back to Rathen and thence to Pötscha, just catching the train. The day was warm and fresh, and the sunlight enchanting. It was a day to remember all our lives. As we got off the train B. saw preparations which made him think they were about to commit a statue in the square.</p>
