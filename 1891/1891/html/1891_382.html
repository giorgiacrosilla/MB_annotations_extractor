		<p>about Christina’s newspaper experiences, and rather despairingly about Bernhard’s books.</p>
		<p>After dinner Bernhard called on the Forbes and Christina and I chatted about her trip, etc.</p>
		<p>Sunday, March 26, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Went to the Bargello, which Christina enjoyed.</p>
		<p>Wrote home.</p>
		<p>Bernhard called on Mr. Benson and talked about Signorelli, and wrote to his sister.</p>
		<p>After tea we walked on Bellosguardo and after dinner read Browning.</p>
		<p>* Monday, March 27, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Duomo and Annunziata and Innocenti in the morning. Saw a Luca della Robbia in the Innocenti we had never studied before, a great beauty!</p>
		<p>Worked on Lotto.</p>
		<p>Walked to San Miniato, and worked on Lotto again.</p>
		<p>Read aloud Ghosts (Ibsen) in the evening, while Bernhard looked at photographs.</p>
		<p>Christina calls him “The Law” or else “The Eternal Light”. He has been deliciously entertaining ever since she has been here. A third person often wakes up conversation. Two people alone tend to become quiet.</p>
