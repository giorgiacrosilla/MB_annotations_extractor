		<p>“Yes”, I said, “but in painting it expresses itself to the eye, and not to the other senses. Everybody would think it absurd to kick a picture.”</p>
		<p>Then, when he was reporting to me Mr. Feilding’s criticisms of the Signorelli of the Uffizi, that such a scale of colour was never seen in nature, I said “You ought to have reminded him that he, who is a musician, produces harmonics of sound that are never heard in nature.” I repeat these to remind myself on dull days, that I can be witty!</p>
