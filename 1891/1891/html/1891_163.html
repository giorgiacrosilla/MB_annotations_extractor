		<p>Wednesday, November 11, 1891, Vienna</p>
		<p>Went to the Museum in the morning, 10-1.15, and rested in the afternoon till Janet came to tea, when we looked at Giorgione, Titian and Palma photographs.</p>
		<p>Did not feel well and had horrible dreams.</p>
		<p>Read Macbeth.</p>
		<p>Thursday, November 12, 1891, Pensione Lejeune, Vienna</p>
		<p>We went first to the CzÃ«rnin gallery, and enjoyed the Ver Meer van Delft. What a wonderful picture!</p>
		<p>Then we went to the Albertina, where I met Mr. and Mrs. Pennell. Mr. Pennell had narrowly escaped transportation to Siberia, and his hair was all turned white.</p>
		<p>We looked at the Venetian drawings, but found very little.</p>
		<p>In the evening we went to hear Manon.</p>
