		<p>him furiously raging over Vernon Lee’s Vanitas</p>
		<p>which contains a complete microscopic dissection of his brother the novelist, “the most incomprehensible, indelicate, indecent thing conceivable.” All this sounded odd from the brother of the man whose “Miss Birdseye” was such a patent caricature of his father’s old friend, Miss Peabody.</p>
		<p>In the evening we read 〈Ibsen’s〉 Rosmershold  and I read Hedda Gabler.</p>
		<p>Thursday, March 9, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Went to the Uffizi and studied Florentine drawings.</p>
		<p>Worked on the Lotto.</p>
		<p>Finished Rosmersholm and compared it with Solness.</p>
		<p>Bernhard called on the Scotts and I went to San Miniato.</p>
		<p>After tea we grappled with the Lotto, and quarrelled, as usual when we write together!</p>
		<p>And in the evening read Vanitas, which didn’t strike us as very bad. I also read the other two stories, one at night, and the other in morning.</p>
