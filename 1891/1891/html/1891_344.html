		<p>Despair. It is so hard to do anything which points towards giving up Ray, yet my position becomes worse each day. I live on in semi-concealment.</p>

		<p>At last Bernhard gave me the choice between retaining Ray at all costs or sticking honourably to him. It is true, it would be absurd to pay for a more than doubtful share in Ray, our whole happiness. Yet the thought of really giving her up, cut my brain literally like a knife. I never suffered such sharp pain. Of course I decided for Bernhard, and now I mean to do all I can to improve our position.</p>
