		<p>beautiful, and suggesting what a Roman street may have looked like. The Loggia 〈dei Mercanti〉 was the finest reconstruction of Roman architecture Bernhard had seen. We saw too some fine terra-cottas modelled by Andrea Sansovino.</p>
		<p>Very tired, went early to bed.</p>
		<p>Friday, November 4, 1892, Nazionale, Cortona</p>
		<p>Took the 8.25 train and arrived here about 9.</p>
		<p>Found a B. della Gatta</p>
		<p>and enjoyed the pictures and architecture as much as is possible when followed by an army of dirty, sniffing, shuffling, curious, greedy (and needy) hangers on.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we drove to Castiglione (Castel Fiorentino) to see B. della Gatta. I wrote this too soon, we did not go, but spent several hours instead enjoying the marvellous Signorellis in S. Niccolo.</p>
		<p>Then I sat on the town wall and saw the sunset while Bernhard explored two of the Renaissance Churches.</p>
		<p>We had a nice dinner at the Garibaldi.</p>
		<p>Saturday, November 5, 1892, Belle Arti, Perugia</p>
		<p>We got up early and I managed to get to both the marvellous churches Bernhard had seen the day before, Santa Maria Nuova and Santa Maria</p>
