		<p>Friday, September 4, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich</p>
		<p>Went to gallery in morning and looked over the drawings. The only ones of note were the Fra Bartolommeos (especially a Head of a Woman); Mantegna, Madonna with an angel on each side; Sodoma, Virtues driving out Vices (analogous to Mantegna’s picture in the Louvre); some small Cupid pictures by Penni; a Mantegna, and a much destroyed Pollaijuolo.</p>
		<p>Afterwards we studied the Italian pictures. B. disagrees with Morelli on several points: 1. That the so-called “Lionardo” is not Flemish but Italian, possibly an early Verocchio. 2. That the so-called Luini is not a Solario. 3. That the Paris Bordone Portrait is not much repainted. 4.</p>
