		<p>Tuesday, January 17, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi. Opera del Duomo. Looked at photos.</p>
		<p>B. reading Voltaire and Tristram Shandy, I at Vol. II of Ranke and my German lesson.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, January 18, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Began our paper on Lotto, studied chronologically.</p>
		<p>Bernhard went to see Vernon Lee, and I went to see Mrs. James, who was so nice and sympathetic, as soon as she found out that I was not a Catholic.</p>
		<p>Sent “Solness” to Evening Post and Women’s Herald.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>* Thursday, January 19, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Still at work on our Lotto. It becomes very interesting.</p>
		<p>Bernhard walked alone, as I felt tired.</p>
		<p>Read Ranke, etc.</p>
		<p>Friday, January 20, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Worked on Lotto. Bernhard called on Loeser, I on Miss Britten.</p>
		<p>Prof. James called, and was most amusing. He said he thought Vernon Lee’s Bellerophon</p>
		<p>was so “full of genius”. He hadn’t the faintest idea what Euphorion</p>
		<p>meant, and as to studying Italian</p>
