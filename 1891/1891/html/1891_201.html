		<p>A glorious spring day!</p>
		<p>Took mother and the children to the cloister of Santa Maria Novella, and then B. and I went to S. Apollonia and S. Egidio to see Andrea del Castagna. [sic]</p>
		<p>After my Italian lesson we walked to Certosa.</p>
		<p>B. lunched with Loeser who talked much about his former mistress, an actress in Germany. He said he could never love her ‘because owing to the birth of a child (not his) her vagina was too large for him. He said it would be a terrible tragedy all through her life – – – – !!</p>
