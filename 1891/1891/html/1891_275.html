		<p>tête-à-tête.</p>
		<p>* Monday, June 13, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>I went to see Carey Thomas, and then we met at the New Salon.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we met Maude and went through Durand-Ruel’s astonishing private collection of pictures by Manet, Monet, Pissaro, [sic] Sisley, etc. The Manet dancing scene was especially wonderful.</p>
		<p>Maude came to spend the night.</p>
		<p>x Tuesday, June 14, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Went early to the New Salon, and shamelessly “got it up.” Carey and Mamie Gwinn came at 10 and I took them round.</p>
		<p>Maude in the evening.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, June 15, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Louvre. New Salon.</p>
		<p>Maude to dine, and the Troyens in the evening. What beautiful music.</p>
		<p>Thursday, June 16, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Pictures, I forget what.</p>
		<p>Dined with Carey who read and liked the manuscript of “The Venetian School.”</p>
		<p>Mr. Burke arrived.</p>
