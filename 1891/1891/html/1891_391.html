		<p>Monday, April 17, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Bernhard started for Rome at 6.35 in the morning.</p>
		<p>I “magazined” his Carl Frey in the morning.</p>
		<p>After lunch I took Miss Lohse to the Pitti and gave her tea here.</p>
		<p>Then finished my “magazining”, had dinner, and worked on the Catalogue.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, April 18, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Unwell.</p>
		<p>Worked all day, on catalogue, story “Crabbed Age”, and other things.</p>
		<p>Bernhard still in Rome.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, April 19, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Still at work.</p>
		<p>Bernhard returned at 9, and had great stories to tell of his millionaire Americans. Mr. Davis was going to pay £12,000 (!) for four utterly worthless pictures, which Bernhard saved him from. They were very amusing, and very American.</p>
		<p>Thursday, April 20, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>We worked all day till 5, going over the Catalogue, sorting photographs, etc., etc.</p>
		<p>Then Bernhard went to call on “Vernon Lee”</p>
