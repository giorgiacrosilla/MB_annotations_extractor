		<p>from the Bagni di Ripoli, a lovely walk.</p>
		<p>Sunday, January 29, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Lotto in the morning, and Bargello.</p>
		<p>I had an attack of pleurisy, so I rested while Bernhard walked over Bello Sguardo.</p>
		<p>After tea we finished correcting our Lotto.</p>
		<p>Had dinner sent in, and read Pater’s “School of Giorgione”</p>
		<p>and talked about it in the evening. As Bernhard says, he writes as if he had a cold in his head - ‘molto costipato’ - He is never clear, but is just on the point of clearing himself out.</p>
		<p>Read Ben Jonson.</p>
		<p>Monday, January 30, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Began to type-write the Lotto.</p>
		<p>Bernhard went to the Bargello.</p>
		<p>After lunch we went to the Academy and S. Annunziata and the Duomo.</p>
		<p>Worked in the evening.</p>
		<p>Read Drummond of Hawthornden.</p>
