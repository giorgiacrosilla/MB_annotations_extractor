His state of mind \u2013 that of a man \u201ctrained\u201d at Oxford in literary traditions puffed out with arrogance, catching the trail of a new science and contending with it, and thinking that of course, as an Oxford man, he must understand it! \u2013 was amusing; but a little goes a long way! He was particularly anxious to be assured that Morelli really was the latest thing, and that he was \u201crecognized\u201d \u2013 but a Fiji islander would have found it as easy to understand what Morelli was about. It made me sad.\nMiss Cooke and Mrs. Clarke, whom I took around the gallery on Sunday, were very much struck by the likeness of the youngest man in Giorgione\u2019s Three Astrologers to Bernhard, and also by certain nuances of likeness in the St. Sebastian attributed to Correggio. It is very curious. Giorgione\u2019s Shepherd at Hampton Court looked so like him, and the young man in the Three Ages, and the Portrait by Botticelli in the Louvre. Miss Cooke\u2019s \u201cfavourites\u201d are the St. Sebastian and \u201cdas grosse Eccehomobild\u201d by Titian. Mrs. Clarke liked Correggio\u2019s Ganymede best.\nI took tea with Janet. She is in a curious state of mind. She is naturally an intellectual but she has tried too much to squeeze herself into a moral mould, and the result is a painful contortion, and she doesn\u2019t know where she is. She is shocking by dependence. She wants some one to tell her what to think, but when they tell her, she grows stiff and angry if the thoughts don\u2019t fit into her perfectly narrow and impossible moral mould.

Families are dependent on their members reciprocally, and dependence (if it be nothing but pecuniary dependence) and independence do not go together.

But to make up for all, we came at the end upon a wonderful little chapel, the private chapel of Eleanora of Toledo, decorated with marvellous frescoes by Bronzino. One of them, the drowning Pharaoh\u2019s army in the Red Sea, had as wonderful a stretch of sunset coloured water as even Besnard could have painted! It reminded us both of Besnard. The figures, too were drawn with his delicious precision, that gives one such a sense of completeness. There is no hesitation, nothing tentative about him.

The journey took 5 hours, from 9 till 2!\nIn the afternoon we walked about the town, and sat in the Cemetery. The first impression of the Piazza is a thing never to be forgotten in any detail. I feel at home with these marvellous views. They remind me of the great stretches of blue mountains and rather bare plain I knew in the West.\nIn the evening B. read Layard and I read L\u00e0 Bas.\nSaturday, March 19, 1892, Siena\nS. Francesco, S. Domenico and the Gallery in the morning.\nAfter lunch we strolled out and looked at the Raffaelino di Fiorenza (Croli?) of Santa Maria dei [sic] Angeli.\nThen we wandered on and on over the hills, entranced with the view. We had a marvelous view from a high hill opposite. The ways were so winding that it took us twice as long to get home as we expected, and I got rather tired.

Immensely rich, and travelling without taking the least pleasure in anything, they are simply the prey of all the human sharks in the shape of waiters and people with things to sell who cross their paths. Aesthetic enjoyment is utterly unknown to them. All they want to know is the subject of a picture. Their curiosity is insatiable, because it comes from absolute ennui and lack of interest. The girl is not so bad, because she is young. But the mother weights on her young life like the Old Man of the Sea. She won\u2019t let her read anything but the things she read when she was young: Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Scott, etc. In short, the poor young creature is absolutely starving in the midst of intellectual plenty. Alas! How many mothers are like that!",
