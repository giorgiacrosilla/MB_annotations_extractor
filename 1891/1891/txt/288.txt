〈Tuesday,〉 August 9, 1892, Birch Hall, Windlesham
I was ill with inflammation of the bowels and worry combined. In fact, when I signed the Deed I was ill, too ill not to be a coward.
Afterwards I spent a long time in bed at Haslemere, suffering a great deal of pain. Ray was very sweet.
Bernhard stayed with his sister and Miss Jordan in London, and then with the Burkes here. Then, on Mr. Burke’s invitation, I came here. What a pleasure it has been to see Bernhard. He is more dear to me that ever.
His sister is here also, and she hates me, as Alys and Logan hate Berenson.
