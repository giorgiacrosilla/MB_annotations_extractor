Wednesday, August 12, 1891, Amsterdam
Came from The Hague here. Read Motley.
Went to Museum. Saw “Night Watch” B.B. said it was a poet’s attempt to translate a commonplace subject into verse, and that it was told better and more appropriately, on the whole, in the good prose of Van du Helst, Jardin, etc.
Saw a Vermeer von Delft and other Rembrandts and Franz Hals.
Very tired.
Read more Motley.
Walked in Kalverstraat.
Discussed the ways of writing history, epic and documental.
