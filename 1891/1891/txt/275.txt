tête-à-tête.
* Monday, June 13, 1892, Paris
I went to see Carey Thomas, and then we met at the New Salon.
In the afternoon we met Maude and went through Durand-Ruel’s astonishing private collection of pictures by Manet, Monet, Pissaro, [sic] Sisley, etc. The Manet dancing scene was especially wonderful.
Maude came to spend the night.
x Tuesday, June 14, 1892, Paris
Went early to the New Salon, and shamelessly “got it up.” Carey and Mamie Gwinn came at 10 and I took them round.
Maude in the evening.
* Wednesday, June 15, 1892, Paris
Louvre. New Salon.
Maude to dine, and the Troyens in the evening. What beautiful music.
Thursday, June 16, 1892, Paris
Pictures, I forget what.
Dined with Carey who read and liked the manuscript of “The Venetian School.”
Mr. Burke arrived.
