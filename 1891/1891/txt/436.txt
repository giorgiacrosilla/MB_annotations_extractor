Michael Field’s “revised and decreased” “Book of Tears”, also letters saying no poet had been so abused since Shelley, and that she could only compare herself to St. John on Patmos when she saw her Play acted. She seems to think it was a great success! The only person who does.
Sent off my review of Morelli to the Chronicle.
Bernhard met Vernon Lee at the Academy. I called on Miss Jeffrey.
Finished Vol. IV of Modern Painters, a horrid mixture of Theology and Geology. Bernhard is reading Scott’s Old Mortality.

Not well, alas! Did nothing, saw nothing, read nothing.

Miss Jeffrey came to lunch, and I took her to S. Lorenzo. She is engaged to a Norwegian writer named Landsem. She was furious when she learned that she would lose her nationality upon being married!
Michael wrote that she had “black drops at the heart” and congratulated me on being “Our Lady of Prose - for a poet’s heart at best is a healthy wound” - a vain poeticule, that is!
Bernhard lunched at Vernon Lee’s. She “lies in his hand as tame as a pear hung basking over the wall,” but he liked her much more when she disputed his opinions instead of swallowing them wholesale.
