Thursday, October 22, 1891, Venice
I was ill, but went for a while to the Academy.
Came home and read Venetian Studies.
Rested in the afternoon and wrote. B. called on Mlle Jackowska.
* Friday, October 23, 1891, Venice
Went to Ducal Palace in morning, and to the Scuola di S. Rocco in the afternoon.
Then I went to the Frari while B. went with Mlle Jackowska to see the paintings of a certain Swiss Baron. He was well bored.
I walked back with Costa along the Giudecca and discussed Sebastiano del Piombo and the great books B. is to write.
Wrote and looked at photos in the evening.

Finished our notes on the Ducal Palace, and then went to S. Giuliano and then met Costa at S. Giovanni Crisostomo.
Then B. went to S. Simeone to see if the ‘Trinity’ there was by Catena or Benedetto Diana.
