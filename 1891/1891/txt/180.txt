to see the charming little Monte di Pietà in the principal Piazza with its balcony at the top with a fence of vase ornaments.
In the evening I read Layard and Guy de Maupassant’s Yvette  and other stories, and B. read Burckhardt upon Giotto and his followers. He found it excellent.
Delicious night sleep.

Took the train at 1 back. It was pretty cold in Arezzo, but we enjoyed ourselves.
Called on Gertrude.
Read Taine on Napoleon’s view of religion in the evening, and Crowe and Ca〈valcaselle〉 on Masolino. Also The Fountain of Youth by Vernon Lee’s brother.
