Went to S. [Jacano] 〈Jacopo〉 Soprarno to look (in vain) for a Lorenzo Monaco. Then Costa came and we talked. B. lunched with him.
I went to see Gertrude and told her she was too ill to get off to Switzerland, then came and took tea with Costa and Loeser at B’s.
We tried to write our Bonifacio in the evening.
I read Zeller.
